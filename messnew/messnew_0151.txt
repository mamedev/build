 [Lord Nightmare, Dwight Elvey, Sandy Bumgarner]

-RSP SIMD changes: [MooglyGuy, Marathon Man]
 * Converted high and middle accumulator slices into SIMD vectors.
 * Converted flag registers into SIMD vectors.
 * Fixed unaligned accesses in CFC2 opcode.
 * Added SCALAR_GET_VS1, SCALAR_GET_VS2, and SET_ACCUM_H/M/L to act as
    a passthrough to either the non-SIMD implementation or individual
    element insert/extract ops in order to minimize #if USE_SIMD all
    over the place.
 * Ported SIMD implementations of VMUDL, VMUDM, VMUDN, VMUDH, VMACF,
    VMACU, VMADL, VMADM, VMADN, and VMADH from CEN64 with permission
 * Resulted in an overall speedup of approximately 50% for RSP-bound
   scenes on a 2.5GHz i5.

-apogee: sound support [shattered]

-Refactored N64 RDP blender to use function arrays in order to [MooglyGuy] 
 flatten inner-loop branch structures for potential  performance.

-Broke blender steps into individual #defines in order to make the [MooglyGuy]
 functional differences between RDP modes more apparent.

-ec1841 updates: [shattered]
 * Emulated the original keyboard
 * DIP switches added
 * Improved memory mapping

-N64 RDP and RSP improvements [MooglyGuy, Marathon Man]
 * Fixed an RSP DMA edge case when transfer count is greater than 1.
 * Refactored the RDP blender implementation to use function pointers
    rather than deep if/else structures in order to reduce branch
    prediction penalties in the inner software rasterizer loop.
 * Reduced the likelihood that bad triangle commands due to an RSP
   crash will crash MESS.

-N64 optimizations: [MooglyGuy]
 * Converted PIF RAM from 8-bit array to 32-bit array
 * Inlined color and alpha combiner equations
 * Moved a number of calculations in span rendering to outer loops
 * Flattened branch structure of texel fetching somewhat

-dectalk.c: fixed the outfifo handler so the 'later 2.0'
 -409/-410 dsp firmware works correctly; some minor documentation
 updates as well, and added a compile-time feature to boost interleave
 when the output fifo is about to run out. [Lord Nightmare]

-dectalk.c: fixed 68k->dsp fifo, hooked up the old 1.8 dsp rom
 version since it works with 1.8 with no glitching and also works with
 2.0 [Lord Nightmare]
