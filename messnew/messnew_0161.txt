Source Changes
--------------
-Adding support for the N64DD [Happy]

-imds2.c: added basic usage info [fulivi]

-gba: vblank at line 160, don't do HIRQ or HDMA during Vblank. 
 This fixes raster effects and glitches in dozens if not hundreds of
 games. [R. Belmont, endrift]

-gba: Hblank IRQs do happen on all scanlines, just DMAs don't.
 [R. Belmont, Endrift]

-abc80: Added cassette sound. [Curt Coder]

-pce/tg16: added default values for pre-formatted BRAM. you
 could obtain the same result by launching PCE or TG-16 with the
 CD-SYSTEM cart and entering the BRAM configuration menu (by pressing
 Select), but it makes sense to be more user-friendly in this case.
 [Fabio Priuli]

-abc80: Emulated a 16KB RAM card. [Curt Coder]

-abc80: Use Z80 PIO pb7_w. (nw)

-abc80: Emulated the Scandia Metric ABC FD2 floppy controller.
 [Curt Coder]

-MT05721: Apply Enik Land's refresh rate workaround so that we
 pass FluBBa's SMS VDP tests.  [Justin Kerk]

-pet: Refactored the Commodore 8050/8250/SFD-1001 to use the new
 floppy system. [Curt Coder]

-gameboy: removed separate implementation of MBC-1 collection
 cart, since it is just plain MBC-1 mapper with slightly different
 address lines wiring. [Tauwasser]

-c64. Added FSD-1 disk drive ROMs. [Ray Carlsen]

-atlantis: added PCI9050 device skeleton. [R. Belmont]

-upd1771: replace waveforms with waveforms extracted from
 upd1771c-017 internal rom. [Lord Nightmare, plgdavid]

-gameboy: added preliminary emulation of Sachen MMC-1 mapper,
 based on reverse engineering by Tauwasser. Logo handling not emulated
 yet (you have to select the "Skip BIOS check" in the System
 Configuration menu to play the games). [Fabio Priuli]

-gameboy.xml/gbcolor.xml: Added some recent dumps of Sachen
 carts [Tauwasser, BigFred, taizou]

-c64: Added ROMs for Indus GT floppy drive. [Ray Carlsen]

-gameboy: added support for the simple multigame mapper used by
 Mani 4 in 1 (DMG-601-CHN). [Fabio Priuli]

-Completely hooked up 6845 in cardline driver. Documented asic
 addresses. [Couriersud]

-Implemented writing to Commodore d64/d67/d71/d80/d82 sector
 images. [Curt Coder]

-Added sector image format for the Commodore 8280 8" floppy 
 drive. [Curt Coder]

-victor9k: Added writing to sector dump disk images. [Curt Coder]

-c4040: Added own sector dump disk format since it's different
 from what the 1541 uses. [Curt Coder]

-plus4: Default to the 1541 disk drive, since the 1551 is rare
 and unreliable. [Curt Coder]

-spc-1000 cassette motor fix for recording fuction working [Miso Kim]

-sms.c: misc improvements: [Enik Land]
 * when GG runs in SMS compatibility mode, avoid access to the PSG
    stereo register.
 * implement the audio control that enables/disables the PSG chip on
    Japanese SMS.
 * play FM sound only when FM chip is enabled.
 * remove mirrors of the IO and memory control ports on the GG driver,
    fixing emulation of G-LOC Air Battle.

-c8050: Added 901884-01 ROM. [Martin Hoffmann-Vetter]

-fsd2: Added REX-DOS. [Julian Perry]
