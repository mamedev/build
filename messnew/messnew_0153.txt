-Converted x68000 keyboard into a separate serial device. This allows
 the removal of the uart hle in the driver (which didn't work, it was
 always two characters behind). diserial cannot sync with the start bit
 properly when using an external clock, so for now I've added a hack
 that is only enabled when using the MC68901 (setting the flag ignores
 the extra spurious bit that was getting shifted in). [smf]

-Replicator 1 driver: [Felipe Sanches]
 * status: no sound / not working
 * general skeleton.
 * basic memory mapping

 * added support for CAS and CPF cassettes
 * added another bios [ranger_lennier]
 * Fixed bad dump in Basic, and added Extended Basic [ranger_lennier]

clcd [smf]
 * Improved the commodore lcd mmu emulation, some software is
   starting to work a bit [smf]

 * added support for bitmap mode [smf]

-indiana: Added IDE controller, fixed 16-bit ISA I/O
 [R. Belmont, Carl]

-Apple II: Support for the Videx UltraTerm card. [R. Belmont]

-gameboy/gbcolor: fixed NVRAM saving. [Fabio Priuli]

-Refactored the Commodore 1541/1551/1571/2031 disk drives to use
 the modern floppy system. [Curt Coder]

-nes: added support for Multi-Discrete PCB (aka Mapper 28) used
 by Action 53 - Function 16 - Volume ONE - "Streemerz Bundle" homebrew
 multicart. [Fabio Priuli]

-nes: added support for PRG-only PCB (aka Mapper 218) which uses
 NT-RAM as CHR-RAM, used by nocash's game Magic Floor. [Fabio Priuli]

-Refactored the Commodore 2040/3040/4040 disk drives to use the
 modern floppy system. [Curt Coder]

-nes_bandai: added emulation of the barcode reader for Datach
 Joint ROM System unit, making playable most games using it.
 [Fabio Priuli]

-nes: Properly implemented the Bandai Datach as a passthru cart.
 Datach games have now to be loaded with the following commands "mess
 nes -cart datach -cart2 gamename" where gamename can be either a
 shortname from the datach softlist, or a fullpath to the iNES files
 (or to headerless 256k dump of the Datach minicarts). This is accurate
 to the hardware, because Datach carts could not be mounted in the main
 Famicom cartridge slot. [Fabio Priuli]

-gl3000s: added LCD and keyboard emulation. [Sandro Ronco]

-spc1000 [Miso Kim, Robbbert]
 * added IRQ which enables cursor flash & internal timer

 homebrew megadrive tutorial file "firststeps".  [Felipe Sanches]

-nes: properly implemented Aladdin Deck Enhancer as a
 pass-through cart. Correct syntax to launch e.g. Dizzy The Adventurer
 is now "mess nes -cart ade -cart2 dizzyadv". Moved Aladdin minicart
 dumps to a separate softlist (but you can load in -cart2 iNES files
 from fullpath, if you like) [Fabio Priuli] nes_camerica: simplified
 emulation of the BF9096 board and fixed emulation of GoldenFive board
 (used by the Polish Pegasus 5 in 1 cart). [Fabio Priuli]

 early '100-A' model with brief descriptions and placeholders for dumps
 not yet obtained.  [Bavarese].

-vtvideo.c: First steps to mimic soft scrolling. Should be
 synchronized with beam or DMA in the future.  [Bavarese]

-apollo: Separate 3c505 out into an ISA16 card. [R. Belmont]

 consoles. [Enik Land]

-fanucspmg: corrected text mode font. [O. Galibert]

-Fix for Thomson MO6 banking, now more faithful to the hardware [Antoine Mine]

 * Fixed SIMD versions of SSV, SLV, SDV, STV, VSUB, VADDC, VSUBC, and
    VGE
 * Removed SIMD optimizations from VMACF, VMADL, VMADN, as they were
   provided by the CEN64 author but do not appear to have the same
   results as MESS's scalar implementations, and so are not trustworthy

-mu100: Main screen turn on [O. Galibert]

-a7800.c: Fixed DMA regarding startup, shutdown and cycle
 stealing which fixes numerous recorded MAMETester bugs.  Bug fixed and
 fine tuned the DMA timing.  Corrected RIOT timing  [Mike Saarna]

 action. [Curt Coder]

-spectrum updates  [MetalliC]
 * BetaDisk fixed (there was just needed to start floppy motor ;)   
 * Pentagon: fixed 7FFD port addressing; CPU clock fixed; adjusted
    VBLANK IRQ timing (border effects works fine now);
 * Scorpion: fixed ports addressing; both machines marked as working.
    Notes:
 * there are still issues with BetaDisk - for unk reason wrong
    commands passed  to WD17xx (imho ROM switching works somehow
    wrong), but anyway with  write protected disk images it works
    more-less fine - files from disks loaded OK;
 * Pentagon1024 randomly crashes then selecting "GLUK BOOT", maybe also
   coz of rom switching.

     shutdown. [Mike Saarna/Robert Tuccitto]

-Attempt to partially rewrite AAKART, and added 4bpp video mode
 for Acorn Archimedes. It now boots at prompt screen, and actually even
 boots into splash screen and dies almost soon with an error if you
 provide a properly initialized NVRAM. [Angelo Salese]

 games can be saved in the expansion without passing through the
 console menu the first time the expansion is used [Fabio Priuli]

-Improving emulation of SONY PVE-500 video editing station [Felipe Sanches]

-bbc: fixed external cart slot -cart1 for the BBC Master (demo cart
