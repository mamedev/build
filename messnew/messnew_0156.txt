Source Changes
--------------
Renamed wizatron.c driver to ticalc1x.c, for TI tms1xxx-based calculators  {hap)

i6300esb: Document more registers [O. Galibert]

Improve Epson LX-810L and ActionPrinter 2000 up to a point where they
actually work. Devices boot and enter main input loop, but input is
not yet implemented. It is possible to run the printers' self test. [Ramiro Polla]

dmv: added mouse input. (Sandro Ronco)

gamecom : [Robbbert]
- Fixed timer in solitaire. Centipede is somewhat playable.
- Fixed calculator.
- Replaced crosshairs with mouse pointer.

ngen: mapped DMA controller, no idea what DMA channels map to what devices, yet.

apple2: rewrote all 8-bit Apple II drivers with an aim towards
modernity and improved runtime performance, improved correctness, and
missing features.  Fixes MT #5157, 5158, 5747, and 5748. [R. Belmont]

ngen: mapped i8254, connected channel 2 to the serial clock, added
 RS232 ports and connected them to the uPD7201.

mc1502: mark CGA unremovable from its slot.

ngen: added basic display, and other little bits of WIP.

made pla_device more generic

ngen: hooked up CRTC and adjusted CRTC clock, resolution and refresh rate
are set to expected values.

pc9801_kbd: fix locks, add missing keys. [Octocontrabass]

vtech1: fixed cassette recording (thanks to ubee for reporting the problem)

mikrosha: add cartslot and one ROM cart

Added tms0970 device [hap]

Backport MBC1COL detection from GoodGBx  [Cowering]

mc1502: re-add speaker output, add more BIOS versions

mc1502: add more ROMs

mc1502: re-add speaker output

redo merlin layout

added simon skillswitch, thanks to Simon from http://www.waitingforfriday.com for making a wiring diagram

dvk_ksm: DEC VT52-compatible video terminal

num9rev: add number 9 revolution 512x32 [Carl]

small cleanup to merlin.c, it is very similar to simon.c

px4: fix initial rs232 status after reset and add the dram test
replacement roms

px4: support clock reading & writing

abc99: Identified unknown ROMs. [robcfg]

px4: use nvram for main memory

px4: clean ups

amstrad: add CRTC Cursor signal to expansion bus, connected to PlayCity
 which now has working NMIs.

amstrad: made PlayCity output in stereo, add the device has its own stereo audio output.

x820ii: Fixed ROM error. [Curt Coder]

psionla: added bios v3.0

Add zero() to (s)vga_device: zeroes all private variables but vtbls.
The vga.memory is resized to 0.

added preliminary emulation of the Bit Corp Gamate [PeT]

amstrad: Added preliminary support for the PlayCity.

x820: Emulated the ASCII keyboard (key repeat is not working yet). [Curt Coder]

d88_dsk: Support some incorrect images [O. Galibert]

nes: fixed NINA-06 mirroring, making Krazy Kreatures and
Mermaids of Atlantis working, and fixing a few glitches in other games
(e.g. the Robert Byrne's Pool Challenge proto). [Fabio Priuli]

spc1000.c: documented hardware differences among
models of the SPC-1000 series [zannylim]

Use the same list of centronics devices everywhere (except the Amstrad CPC),
 the list has been renamed as they aren't all printers. [smf]

astrocade: converted the expansion bus to be a slot
device, and converted RAM expansions to be slot cards. As a
result you now specify the expansion you want by using e.g.
	mess astrocde -exp blue_ram_32k
or the Slot Devices menu of the internal UI, instead of using the
DipSwitches menu. Check the -lslot output for a list of available
expansions. [Fabio Priuli]

ti85: use direct update handler to remove boot memory mapping hacks  [Jon Sturm]

Correctly model the behavior of a real Coco for the Cassette input in
 regards to audio (buzzing sound) coming from the port.  [Richard Goedeken]

 - ec1841: change keyboard xtal freq, add speech synthesis swre
 - ec1841: new softlist item
 - ec184x: MDA clone
 - ec184x, iskr103x: use custom set of ISA cards
 - kb_ec1841: use correct clock frequency
 - isa_hdc: ec1841 compatibility

 - isa_hdc: add ioport for DIPs, make ROM optional (makes this device work with ec1841)
 - isa_hdc: add DIPs, make ROM optional
 - ie15: use utf-8 in keyboard layout description
 - ie15: init palette, minor cleanup
 - iskr103x: CGA clone
 - poisk1: add newer revision of HDC BIOS

spc1000: converted the expansion bus EXT1 to be a
slot device, moved FDD expansion to be a slot card, added
emulation of the VDP expansion as another slot card. This
makes Gun Fright, TwinBee and Zanac playable if you launch
them with "-ext1 vdp" option. If you want to emulate a
SPC-1000 with floppy drive, you have to add "-ext1 fdd"
instead. [Fabio Priuli]

Convert PSX sio to use devcb. [smf]

astrocde.c: added support for 256K and 512K carts
with bankswitch. [Fabio Priuli]

ti85: add basic support for the TI-84 Plus  [Jon Sturm]
       *  Add known dump of TI-84 Plus which has been sent to a mess dev and
       supports ennough asic functionality that it boots and runs.
       *  Fixed up model enum to match style from the apple2 and used it to add
       support for where the ti84p differs from the ti84pse.
       *  Consolidated code for the 15Mhz calculators so there is less
       duplicated code between the ti83pse, ti84pse and ti84 support code.

spc1000: added emulation of joystick inputs [Fabio Priuli]

added software list for Samsung spc1000 tapes [Fabio Priuli]

[Richard Goedeken]

ti85.c:  [Jon Sturm]
	* Improved support of TI83 Plus, TI83 Plus Silver Edition, and TI84 Plus,
	and TI84 Plus Silver Edition by switching over to bankdev and adding
	proper flash chips.  	They should be working now (press Q to power on).
