Removed old index-based DISCRETE_ADJUSTMENT and then renamed the newer
DISCRETE_ADJUSTMENT_TAG to replace it. Updated all callers. 
[Aaron Giles]

Removed all uses of input_port_by_index(), and removed the function.
[Fabio Priuli, Aaron Giles]

Added saves to 6522via.c. This fixes problems of gameplan.c and 
trvquest.c games with -autosave. [Fabio Priuli]

Enabled GAME_SUPPORTS_SAVE flag to dday.c because some of the core 
changes have fixed the sound problem at loading. [Fabio Priuli]

Imported SAA5050 emulation from MESS and made it a device. Updated 
malzak.c to use it, removing the almost identical implementation in 
the driver. [Fabio Priuli]

Added TILE_GET_INFO_DEVICE and SET_TILE_INFO_DEVICE macros to 
tilemap.c. [Fabio Priuli]

Made MB14241 Shifter IC a device and moved its source to emu/machine. 
Updated mw8080bw.c and 8080bw.c accordingly. Also converted fgoal.c 
to use this implementation in place of its own version. [Fabio Priuli]

Enhanced the UML opcodes for LOAD, LOADS, and STORE to support
arbitrary scaling factors. Previously, specifying a size implied
a scaling factor equal to the size (i.e., specifying DWORD meant
the index was scaled by 4). This is still the default. However,
now you can specify the scale explicitly for other cases. For
example, you can specify DWORD_x1 to fetch a DWORD but don't
scale the index at all, or BYTE_x8 to fetch a BYTE while scaling
the index by 8. Updated all backends to make this work. [Aaron Giles]

 - Added device versions of all the Konami custom ICs currently 
    emulated in machine/konamiic.c and video/konamiic.c

    flkatck.c, hcastle.c, labyrunr.c and suprslam.c to use the

 - Updated 88games.c, battlnts.c, bladestl.c and rockrage.c to use new

 - Updated asterix.c and moo.c to use the new devices.
 - Converted aliens.c, blockhl.c, crimfght.c and gbusters.c to use

Fixed tilemaps so they can be initialized at device start time.
[Aaron Giles]

Added redumped roms to coolridr. [David Haywood]

Fixed crash on exit for systems with no tilemaps. [Aaron Giles]

Added warning messages for auto_malloc, timer, and save state
allocations done after init time. These should be fixed when detected,
and will soon be disallowed entirely. Fixed many cases in the code
where this was being done. [Aaron Giles]

Converted Taito F3 sound to a separate machine driver which is
imported into games that use it. [Aaron Giles]

Converted the balsente driver to driver_data structure. [Aaron Giles]

Some more Atari driver shuffling. Added atarigen_init() function
which allocates all timers and registers for save states. Updated
all drivers to call it. Converted some drivers to use device timers.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed ticket.c into a device, updated all users. [Aaron Giles]

CIA6526: fixed FLAG handling and slight interface cleanup. 
[Curt Coder]

Moved SNES timer allocation to MACHINE_START. [Fabio Priuli]

Koi Koi Part 2: written an hardcoded table (disabled by default), 
concluded that a color prom is currently undumped. Also documented a 
bunch of unused ports [Angelo Salese]

Carrera: fixed colors [Angelo Salese]

Sky Army: cleaned up the driver, also removed the GAME_WRONG_COLORS 
flag since the colors actually seems correct according to the 
references. [Angelo Salese]

Trivia Madness: Improved graphics & colors [Angelo Salese]

Super Rider: improved bitplane order and colors [Angelo Salese]

Preliminary RSP recompiler, with all vector ops stubbed out to C 
functions for now. [Harmony]

sbowling.c - Added proper COINAGE selections as well DIP LOCATIONS to 
the driver. Added mapping for button 1 which is used to allow change 
from curve to straight throw. Replaced clock speeds with XTAL values.
[Tafoid]

Re-implemented 3d rasterization in the hng64 driver as a FIFO system.
[Andrew Gardner]

ggconnie.c - Added DIP LOCATIONS to match those showing in service 
mode.  Added game year to source from title screen. [Tafoid]

Added preliminary decryption to Victor 5, Victor 21 and Cross Bingo 
[David Haywood]

Decoded Cross Bingo proms [Angelo Salese]

hexa.c - Added DIP LOCATIONS as well as assigned XTAL for the clock 
speeds, using those from Arkanoid, since the boards are nearly 
identical in many aspects. [Tafoid]

RSP recompiler improvements / optimizations: [Harmony]
 - Split SATURATE_ACCUM into a signed and unsigned version to reduce 
    stack usage.
 - Corrected an issue with the 0h variants of VMRG, VAND, VNAND, VOR, 
    VNOR, VXOR and VNXOR.
 - Slightly optimized unaligned reads and writes
 - Optimized unaligned dword reads
 - Corrected an issue where badly-written RSP programs could jump to 
    invalid addresses

Added new profiler bucket for DRC recompilation. [Aaron Giles]

luckgrln: Implemented CRT Controller hook-up [Angelo Salese]

gomoku.c, sspeedr.c - Added DIPS and changed clock values to XTAL
[Tafoid]

nitedrvr.c, tourtabl.c - Changed clock values to XTAL [Tafoid]

Added new option "numprocessors" (see windows.txt for an explanation).
[couriersud]

Optimized N64 RDP renderer by using function pointers to function 
variants that eliminate costly branches. [Harmony]

Minor drc improvments: [Aaron Giles]
 - simplified RSP's misaligned memory accesses
 - removed now-unnecessary shifts from direct memory accesses in
    mips3/powerpc drcs
 - optimized AND with 0xff/0xffff/0xffffffff cases for x86/x64
 - added rudimentary memory/register tracking in x86 backend to
    remove redundant loads

cb2001 improvements: [robiza]
 - added ay8910 and 8255ppi devices
 - added some info about relation between cmast91 and cb2001
 - added many opcodes

Fixed sprite-tilemap priorities in Super Slams [Angelo Salese]

Worked around protection in sranger, srangerw and srangerb 
[Angelo Salese]

Converted 7474, 74148, and 74153 TTL implementations to devices.
[Aaron Giles]

More rom name corrections for the merit.c driver [Brian Troha]

Added Guru's board notes to the Outrun/Super Hang-on Driver.
[Guru]

several drivers [Atari Ace]

Fixed Brick Zone parent set bitplane graphics [Angelo Salese]

Fix megadrive emulation to use the SMSIII version of the sn76489 
sound chip. [Lord Nightmare, DFJustin]

Added save states to ics2115 sound device. [Fabio Priuli]

Changed EEPROM usage in many drivers to use the new device version.

Removed auto-init hack from some Konami games. Hold down F2 and reset
(via F3) to initialize the EEPROM, like all the other Konami games.
[Fabio Priuli]

Cleaned up EEPROM device implementation a bit. [Aaron Giles]

Added flickering effect in Super Slams title screen 
[Angelo Salese, Guru]

Fixed sprite bank bit in Spark Man [Angelo Salese]

Converted gaelco3d.c to use eeprom device code. [Fabio Priuli]

Spark Man: Refactored the protection, implemented thrash protection 
that's used after the title screen. [Angelo Salese]

EEPROM device now looks for a matching memory region to fetch the
default values from. Fixed bug in ROM loader that would change the
memory region flags to match devices with no address bus. Updated
groundfx to use the new default loading scheme. [Aaron Giles]

Reworked the hng64 polygon chunk recovery code to be more crash-proof.
Documented what's known about the 3d data much better. Fixed vertex 
ROM loading for fatfurwa and buriki. [Andrew Gardner]

Converted rtc65271 to a device. [Aaron Giles]

Added "new" command -listdevices (or -ld) to list the devices attached
to a driver. I notice that MESS has a command with the same name; 
hopefully the behaviors can be combined eventually. [Aaron Giles]

Got rid of explicit resource tracking for state saving. Now we just 
use the auto_ allocators, since registration is restricted to 
initialization. [Aaron Giles]

Moved machine->gfx initialization out of the video module and into
drawgfx. We now call this before devices are initialized, so that 
devices can dynamically append to the machine->gfx as needed.
[Aaron Giles]

i386 improvements: [Barry Rodewald]
 * minimal implementation of the LSL protected mode instruction
 * fixed the REP instruction when used with a segment prefix.

Updated readme for Race Drivin' Compact. [Guru]

Fixed a couple of edge case parsing bugs in srcclean.c. [Atari Ace]
