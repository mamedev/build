12446: nichibutsu/cclimber.cpp: Improves Swimmer driver and adds a new game set [NeilBakersTech]
Hey folks. I was granted access to a private arcade collection to repair some game boards and an unusual one caught my eye.
The game board stack was a Tehkan Swimmer, the same as one in my own collection but with modifications to the CPU and Video layers.
Using a Willem programmer I was able to read the EPROM data as 2764 and 2764 types and a grep of MAME code returned no match on the
  checksums.
When trying to add it to MAME it did not work when renamed as Swimmer and creating replacement EPROMs for my Swimmer game board
  yielded no results either.
I spent some time making technical notes from my Swimmer game board to understand the working of the board and source of the
  problem. These notes did not allow the game to run either but led me to see some problems with MAME and the emulation of Swimmer.
Foremost there are numerous places on the game board where address lines are not fully decoded resulting in what MAME calls
  mirroring. It can be seen on the input section where MAME had separated ports. I have corrected these.
Specific to Swimmer and not Crazy Climber is the sound latch handling. The Swimmer board is a Tehkan game board and uses the same
  flp-flop configuration with LS273 as found on Bomb Jack for clearing sound latch on read.
After fixing these mistakes in MAME and performing a routine cleaning of the source files I began narrow down what was required to
  run this new ROM.
Without ongoing access to the modified game board I am unable to determine how the alterations work on hardware but they provide 2
  new RAM areas over the standard Swimmer configuration. One of them bypasses the fixed color generation circuits of the original by
  providing dynamic colors with 3 bits per gun while the other acts as scratch RAM.
The ROM started up as a game I had not heard of before 'Au' with a copyright of 1983
I have begun understand the Dipswitch requirements but could not discover the meaning for a couple. Is there an AI game code
  analysis tool to help with them or is it a labor intensive process?
Please thank Neill Baker Tech if you decide to include my changes.

12525: spg2xx: Switch ADPCM algorithm to IMA ADPCM [sp1187]
Based on some investigations I made of V.Smile sound samples and the waveforms generated by different algorithms, it seems very

In #12514 rb6502 proposed to change the hp_dio cards to an anymous namespace, like the intelliset bus. So here's the PR changing the
  cards.

12529: nmk/nmk16.cpp: Adjusted values for proper screen size, timings and interrupts, according to real hw [sergiopolog]
Fixed screen size, interrupts and raster timings on nmk16 driver to be more accurate with original hw.
This hardware relies on two counters and the contents of two PROMs for the timing signals generation. The counters are implemented
  inside NMK-902 custom chip (except `tharrier`) for all "low-res" games and are used to address the entries on each PROM in a
  sequential way. On "hi-res" games, one of the counters is implement outside the custom chip, due to they decided to boost up the
  horizontal resolution.
- "Horizontal" signals, such as HBlank, HSync... are generated using one of the counters and a 256x4bit PROM, and each step on the
  counter takes 2 pixel clock cycles.
  - For "low-res" games the counter starts on `0x40` and goes to `0xFF` having 192 steps. As each step is 2 px, so the total H-size
  is 384px wide. PROM entries from `0x00` to `0x39` address are never used.
  - For "hi-res"  games the counter starts on `0x00` and goes to `0xFF` having 256 steps. As each step is 2 px, the total H-size is
  512px wide. All PROM entries are used.
- "Vertical" signals, such as VBlank, Interrupt requests... are generated using the other counter and a 256x8bit PROM, and each step
  on the counter takes 2 scanlines.
  - In this case, for all games the counter starts on `0x75` and goes to `0xFF` having 139 steps. As each step is 2 lines, the total
  V-size is 278 lines high. PROM entries from `0x00` address to `0x74` are never used.
Going into more detail:
The H-timing PROMs is a 82S129 (256x4bit) (first 64 entries are not used in "low-res") and the format is:
```
    Offset  Bits     Description
            3210
    0       ---x     Line counter trigger (active low)
    1       --x-     HSYNC (active low)
    2       -x--     HBLANK (active low)
    3       x---     unused on almost all games (only used in gunnail and raphero, purpose unknown)
```
Considering that and looking at the contents of the PROM, the horizontal timings are below:
- For "low-res" (6MHz pixel clock):
```
                         0.....31.........91.....................................................................348.....366.....383
/LINE-END (2 px):        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X

  // HBlank ends 92 pixels after 'start of line'
                         ^
                         |
                 'start of line'  (pixel 0)
```
				 
Each line:         ( 6MHz / 384 pixels per line )  =  15625Hz  =  64 usec
- For "hi-res" (8MHz pixel clock):
```
                         0...27............................................................................412...432...448.479...511
/LINE-END (2 px):        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X
HSYNC  (32 px):          ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------XXXXXXX------
HBLANK (28 + 100 px):    XXXXXX-------------------------------------------384-wide-------------------------XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  // HBlank ends 28 pixels after 'start of line'
                         ^
                         |
                 'start of line'  (pixel 0)
```
Each line:         ( 8MHz / 512 pixels per line )  =  15625Hz  =  64 usec
For V-timing PROM, it's a 82S135 (256x8bit) (first 117 entries are not used) and the format is:
```
    Offset  Bits         Description
            76543210
    0       -------x     Sprite DMA trigger (active low)
    1       ------x-     VSYNC (active low)
    2       -----x--     VBLANK (active low)
    3       ----x---     unused
    4       ---x----     IRQ1 (active high)
    5       --x-----     IRQ2 (active high)
    6       -x------     IRQ4 (active high)
    7       x-------     Interrupt Trigger (active low and effective on the very next PROM entry (2 scanlines), the interrupt is
  triggered on 0 to 1 transition)
```
Considering that and looking at the content of the PROM, the vertical timings are below:
```
                         0.8.13..22.37.....................................................................................262...277
/SPR-DMA-START (2 lines):--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X--------

Active video time: ( 6MHz / 384 pixels per line ) / 224 lines per Active    =   69.75446428Hz = 14336 usec
Time between IRQ1: ( 6MHz / 384 pixels per line ) / 128 lines between IRQ1s =  122.0703125Hz  =  8192 usec
Given that, the screen size, HBlank and VBlank are adjusted on each case. Interrupts and video offsets are also fixed to their
  proper positions.
On a later Pull-Request I'll submit new code for triggering interrupts based on the actual contents on the V-timing PROM, in order
  to trigger the interrupts dynamically and allowing each game trigger them by its own, instead of hardcoding them on the code. It's
  known that IRQ1 in 'bioship' and 'vandyke` is a bit shifted compared to other games, and some hi-res games don't use IRQ2.
No clue how they implemented it on Afega games hw, but they work in the same way.
Additionally, flip-screen is fixed for `vandyke`, `bioship` and clones. Contrary to rest of games, `vandyke` writes a 1 instead of 0
  when flip-screen is required, so a new adapter handler is added for that special case.
Adjusted `MACHINE_NO_COCKTAIL` flag on:
- removed from: `macross2`, `tdragon2`, `sabotenb`, `bjtwin`, `nouryoku`, `ssmissin`, `airattck` and clones of all them
- added to: `tharrier`, `stagger1`, `grdnstrm`, and clones

12535: heathzenith/z37_fdc.cpp: Fix HDOS 2.0 INIT (disk formatting) [mgarlanger]
Fixes disk formatting under HDOS 2.0. 
This change is not needed for HDOS 3.0 or CP/M 2.2.04 disk formatting.
Verified with the schematics, the ready line is tied to +5V. 

12537: konami/firebeat: Add pop'n music Animelo 2 (JAA) [987123879113]
Some version difference details: pop'n Animelo 2 (JAA) has a nonstop mode that lets you play all of the songs in the game until you
  either clear them or fail. It was removed in later revisions of the game, so it's a substantial change compared to the existing
  JAC version. And as was the same with the JAC version, a dongle with an expired license makes the game swap out all of the anime
  license-related artwork with more generic replacement artwork.
Also added some newly discovered info about the seemingly first game to use the Twinkle game, Ugoke! Purimucho also thanks to Taro.
  The schematic text is too hard to read but I included it in the email.

12545: nmk/nmk004.cpp: redumped internal ROM of NMK004 sound CPU [sergiopolog]
It was dumped from two different devices taken from `acrobatm` and `tdragon` boards.
![NMK004 dump](https://imgur.com/pi6B6jc)
The dump was exactly the same from those 2 devices, so I consider it a good and reliable dump. It was achieved using a custom tool
  to read internal ROMs from TLCS90 MCUs: https://github.com/sergiopolog/tlcs90-rom-reader
Previously existing dump made by 'trap15' only differs in 3 bytes starting at 0xFBD address. That difference could be caused by the
  method used to extract the ROM back then.
Actually, I talk to him about it and he stated that area around 0xFBF address was marked as unsure when he carried out the process.

Croket! Itada Kinka! Banker Battle!! (Japan) [Team Europe, Peter Wilhelmsen, David Haywood]
Shooting King (Japan) [Team Europe, Peter Wilhelmsen, David Haywood]
Gun Gun Revolution (Japan) [Team Europe, Peter Wilhelmsen, David Haywood]
these all run, but lack inputs.  Excite Ping Pong 2 has some graphical corruption which looks like it might be bitrot, so is marked
  as bad (reads were consistent)

12553: igs/igs_fear.cpp - add IGS027A dump to fearless [tormod, Peter Wilhelmsen, XingXing] [mamehaze]
igs_fear.cpp - add IGS027A dump to fearless

12554: seibu/goal92.cpp: DIP Switches updates [UnclePetros]
- Added DIP Switches (DIPSW2) (used cupsoc implementation)
- Updated existing DIP Switches to show placeholder in DIP Switches menu

12555: Fixes/ROMs for Roland stuff [giulioz]
- Renames `rolandpcm` into `roland_lp` to make it distinct from other PCM chips
- Adds a skeleton for the GP (TC6116) chip
- Fixes the T6963C LCD controller by adding ram read support and correct text/graphics enable register handling. This makes the
  Roland D-70 behave correctly with message popups
   <img width="997" alt="image" src="https://github.com/mamedev/mame/assets/1353142/f510de21-3808-4d2e-b880-f83ce2b0dbb4">
- Fixes the allocation of waveroms in the Roland D-70
- Adds the first ever dump of the internal mask ROM of the Roland D-50 CPU
- Fixes the memory map of the JV80 and wires up the PCM chip skeleton
- Adds a skeleton and ROM dumps for the RD-500

12558: atari/atetris.cpp: Redumped Link graphics ROM [Taksangs] [clawgrip]

12559: nmk/nmk16.cpp: Fix max sprite clock related to screen size [cam900]

12561: Add HP9133 disk drive [svenschnelle]
This adds the HP9133 disk drive, which was common with HP9000 200 and 300 systems. It also adds a sync acknowledge callback to the
  6809, and multi sector read/write to wd2010.

12562: nmk/nmk16.cpp: upgraded interrupts trigger system based on PROM contents [sergiopolog]
* Added a new system for triggering interrupts based on PROM contents:  `set_interrupt_timing()` and `nmk16_scanline`.
* Bootleg sets, Afega and Comad games, and other sets that PROMs are still undumped (or not exist), on which the new interrupt
  triggering system cannot be applied, remain using the old `set_hacky_interrupt_timing()` and `nmk16_hacky_scanline` handlers.
* Added info about screen resolutions and timings.
* Removed "hacky" denomination to `set_screen_xxxxxx()` functions as the screen sizes are confirmed for each available resolution
* PROM dumps from `hachamfp` are added to `hachamf` and other clones, and marked as `BAD_DUMP` until they are properly dumped
* PROM dumps from `bjtwin` are added to `nouryoku` and clones, and marked as `BAD_DUMP` until they are properly dumped
* `strahl` and clones could benefit from the new interrupt system, but PROMs for them are undumped. They still use the old system
  until they are properly dumped
* `ssmissin` and `airattck` "Comad" games could also benefit from the new interrupt system, but the V-Timing PROM on them is a
  82S147 (512x8bit) in which only half of space is used and A5 address line is tied to ground. The `nmk16_scanline` code could be
  tweaked to support them, but more research is needed to apply that. They still use the old system.
* Merged `powerins.cpp` into `nmk16.cpp` driver to make use the new interrupt system, too. New `set_screen_midres()` function is
  added to be used by `powerins` sets.
* Sprite DMA process might be triggered using PROM contents aswell, but that needs more testing and it could be a future
  enhancement.

12563: igs/igs_fear.cpp: made game playable without sound [XingXing] [HappyASR]
- added timer and interrupt
- added rtc
- add input and dipswitch
- add fipx in sprite drawing
- correct game version of superkids

12565: nintendo/snesb.cpp: fill in missing DIP switches for several games, add continue counter init for Wild Guns [devinacker]
This adds/verifies the DIP definition for all the SNES bootlegs that had a TODO for them. Defaults are based on the original SNES
  games, when possible, aside from Wild Guns (the original gives extends at 100k, which isn't an option with this bootleg, so the
  default is 400k to match current MAME behavior).
Also, Wild Guns now inits the continue counter on boot/reset, which is apparently supposed to be done by whatever's on the other
  side of the shared RAM. The only times it's initialized by the game itself are when the current counter hits zero or when a second
  player joins mid-game. I promoted it to working since I didn't encounter any other issues during a full playthrough.

12567: dectalk: fixed distortion in DTC07 DAC emulation [datajake1999]

12570: casio/pv1000.cpp: Three tiny changes [lidnariq]
* ioFF has a toggle that just draws border color instead of tiles, so that the CPU runs faster.
* The pixel clock is slow, so the pixel aspect is noticeably wide - about 4:3
* ioFF supports drawing tile data from all eight 8KiB windows out of the 64KiB address space; add support for the easy bottom four

12571: taito/buggychl.cpp: add description of undumped versions. [negunma]
Add other known undumped versions:
- Another ranking song version - ported to PS2 "Taito Memories".
  https://youtu.be/JXIvaM5508c?si=wCojMales2Kg9L7u&t=270 (Ranking 1st song)
  https://youtu.be/Btnl9FYTiL8?si=rrGTblIfOlIQo6NJ&t=308 (Ranking 2nd song)
- 2 player joystick version - after inserting a coin, 
  instead of "START YOUR ENGINE", it displays "PUSH ONLY 1-PLAYER BUTTON".
  https://youtu.be/iE9-q4IruS4?si=eYL5_iXDZDyH9TS_&t=31
  (The title of this video states that this is the joystick version)
- Japanese version - after inserting a coin, instead of "START YOUR ENGINE", 
  it displays "セレクトボタンをおしてね！！(Press select button!!)" 
  and "クレジット(Credit)" instead of "CREDIT".

12572: spg2xx: Fix behavior of audio channel enable/stop flags [sp1187]
Summary of new behavior:
* Automatic stops sets channel stop flag while keeping channel enable flag unchanged (unlike current emulation where it's cleared). 
* Channel is only active (channel status flag true) when enable flag is true and stop flag is false.
This was verified in real hardware by running audio test roms on V.Smile. From what testing I have done so far, the changes don't
  really affect the games much if at all, but it should be technically more accurate.

12575: speglsht.cpp: Add notes [cam900]
Transparent color is wrong at title screen animation, reference: https://youtu.be/cK7mGnt6YfY?si=Ah5hC_iFS2Li7Xwl

12580: spg2xx: Auto-increment wave address register when channel is playing [sp1187]
Also discovered from testing in real hardware (V.Smile). Probably not likely to noticeably affect games, but should still be
  technically more accurate.

12585: upd765: Drive busy bits should not be cleared until a SIS is executed [brijohn]
The upd765 does not clear the drive busy bits until you issue a sense interrupt status command. Without this fix CP/M Plus on the
  QX-10 gives disk I/O errors because it expects the busy bit to stay set until it has a chance to issue the SIS command.
I have verified this is the correct behavior on a real QX-10, which uses a NEC D765AC as its floppy controller. Regarding the
  cpc6128, this fix does not seem to cause an issues with accessing a disk, I can run cat from basic and get a directory as well
  load files from the disk. Same thing with the specpl3e, loading programs from disk appears to work fine.

12588: rs232: Add Mouse Systems serial mouse to default rs232 list. [brijohn]

12617: cpu/xa: CPU core work for fearless/superkds - adds sound, promotes to working [mamehaze]
(squashed version of the PR, as requested)
this adds basic execution to XA core.  It emulates enough of the XA to give fearless and superkds working sound.
some considerations
- only the exact forms of the opcodes used so far have been implemented
- no optimizations have been done, use of const, inline use, templates etc. are planned for a future update; code is still primed
  for debugging and development
- overall structure, code style are not 100% final (see above) and will be adjusted as the CPU is better understood
- peripherals, interrupts etc. are not yet fully implemented, nor is anything outside of the page zero mode used here due to lack of
  test cases

-cpu/xa: CPU core work for fearless/superkds - adds sound, promotes to working (#12617) [mamehaze]
 * This adds basic execution to XA core. It emulates enough of the XA to give fearless and superkds working sound.
 * only the exact forms of the opcodes used so far have been implemented
 * no optimizations have been done, use of const, inline use, templates etc. are planned for a future update; code is still primed
    for debugging and development
 * overall structure, code style are not 100% final (see above) and will be adjusted as the CPU is better understood
 * peripherals, interrupts etc. are not yet fully implemented, nor is anything outside of the page zero mode used here due to lack
    of test cases
