  Springs. 50 Lions parent/clone swapped (Australian set is now parent).
  [Heihachi_73]

- Improved Last Bank driver, added bare-bones graphics and inputs
  [Angelo Salese]

- Makyosen was redumped with corrected rom names which are now
  documented in driver.  [Yohji, Smitdogg, The Dumping Union]

- Dumped missing u11 gfx rom in Last Bank [Smitdogg, The Dumping Union]

- Basic device-ization of the TC0091LVC [Angelo Salese]

- PALs for Vigilante have been added, but not hooked up yet.  The old
  PAL(4m) has been determined to be bad.  [Corrado Tomaselli]

- dsp32c changes: [Phil Bennett]
 * Set the PCR to 1 on reset
 * Update the PDF/PIF output pin states only when reading/writing the
   PDR/PIR registers.
 * Implemented the goto_pde, goto_pdf, goto_pif and goto_pdf
   instructions

- harddriv updates: [Phil Bennett]
 * Implemented diagnostic jumper and DIP switches for all games
 * Added a workaround to prevent racedrivb1 and racedrivg1 from
    crashing on boot
 * Use the common 68681 DUART implementation
 * Use XTAL values for CPU clocks

- legionna.c: Added priority BPROM to the Heated Barrel sets. Corrected
  rom names and added PCB locations. [Smitdogg, The Dumping Union]

- PORT_ADJUSTER now accepts PORT_MINMAX as well. [Couriersud]

- Implemented a generic implementation to model discrete net lists.
  [Couriersud]
 * Based on timeslot modelling, the implementation models gate delays
    in logic chips.
 * Design ready to be split into a generic and a MAME implementation
    part.
 * Design prepared to merge in discrete components from discrete.*
 * Supports code based as well as external net list parsing.
   Ultimately, net lists and discrete emulation should share one code
   base. The class design was set up to accomplish this. There is no
   point in having multiple 555, 7474 implementations around. Most of the
   code will be moved to lib/netlist going forward to allow usage in
   other projects.

- Pong now uses netlist.h. This implementation reproduces all gate
  timing and 555 related effects as described by Dr. H. Holden in his
  2012 publication "ATARI PONG E CIRCUIT ANALYSIS & LAWN TENNIS".
  [Couriersud]

- midwunit.c: Corrected the rom labels for Open Ice and added notes
  about the specific "L" revision of the roms. [Brian Troha]

  [Markus Rathgeb]

- Did a first-pass clone creation/set split for the acesp.c driver.  As
  a result, another 500 or so sets have been added to the gamelist. 
  [David Haywood]

  locations. [Brian Troha]
