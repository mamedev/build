9946: Juku E5101/E5104 into working machine status [boamaod]
Added:
* Sound (three volume levels)
* Graphics modes 384x200, 400x192 (and 256x192)
* Text modes 64x20, 80x24
* EKDOS 2.29 and 2.30 hashes
Fixed:
* Floppy side selection
* Broken floppy write routine
* Partially mapped memory mode 0
* Some descriptions

11862: sega/sega_ferie.cpp: Add new not working system [qufb]
Basic functionality is implemented. I haven't tried most features of this system, which is why it's marked MACHINE_NOT_WORKING.
Some changes done in Z80 base class were required to support T6A84's multiple address spaces / memory pages:
* Stack reads and writes are handled by dedicated virtual functions. In this case, they are overridden to use a distinct address
  space;
* For interrupts, I considered using daisy-chain, but this would require even more changes to the base class. Additionally to
  fetching interrupt vectors, we need to execute interrupt routines in a distinct page. This seems easier to support by adding a new
  "return from interrupt" callback to handle switching mapped pages;

12831: Update megadriv.xml for ESPN Hockey Night [PsychoFox11]
I've been looking into this ROM as the trusted dump and scene dumps on no-intro did not match and were marked bad as Mame considers
  them bad. I did my own testing, as I don't think one db should rely on another or why be separate? Dumping 3 copies on Sanni's
  OSCR reader, plus desoldering a chip and dumping it with a Backbit chip tester, I get the hashes I'm updating it to here.
While I don't think MAME should consider it bad because No-intro does or vice-versa, I'm the dumper and glad to answer any questions
  to both projects. If I should be noting this elsewhere please let me know.
Also worth noting, the difference is only a few bits, looking more like bit rot on the one recorded under MAME than a revision etc.
My 3 dumps (as well as 2 other named sources getting these hashes, and one unknown source getting the current MAME hash) have been
  added to no-intro, with cart/PCB pics, should  you care to review them.

- Update comments.

12934: tehkanwc: correct refresh rate [jotego]
Small edit to:
- confirm that the vblank time is correct (comment removed)
- correct the refresh rate (derived from my extracted schematics)
- make the palette a _ram()_ so it matches the PCB (again, see schematics). It also makes it possible to dump it on MAME debugger
  (which is convenient for my workflow, please allow it)
video timing:
!image
schematics  (missing a few signals, work in progress)

12935: Update toaplan2.cpp [PabloArcade]

12942: added IGS027A and CG ROM dumps to icescape [TeamEurope, Peter Wilhelmsen, XingXing] [mamehaze]

12943: upd7220: Fix pitch calculation in rdat/wdat routines [brijohn]
When the upd7220 is calculating the next EAD for read or write operation it should look at the GD bit set with the FIGS command and
  when it is set during mixed mode half the pitch value. This was already being done for the graphics figure drawing functions, but
  the rdat,wdat and dma read/write functions were using the unmodified pitch.
This causes a noticeable problem in valdocs on the QX-10 as it uses wdat to draw its block cursor, but the pitch value is set to 80
  characters per line, but when drawing graphics needs to be halved to reach the correct next effective address. In valdocs this
  would show up as the cursor being twice as tall with a gap between every other line.
Writing some test code on my QX-10 that sets mixed mode with a pitch of 80 and then draws a block cursor with and without the GD bit
  being set seems to support this as well.
I tested this patch with the following systems and I did not notice any obvious issues:
PC-98 (various games)
VT240
DEC Rainbow (Graphics diagnostics)
NCR Deskmate V (Graphics demos)

12944: epson/qx10.cpp: Revert commits that broke zoom handling on the QX10 [brijohn]
I noticed when testing #12943 that the zoom diag tests were broken on the QX10, bisecting showed that it was these two commits that
  broke things.
Revert "epson/qx10.cpp: rectify previous commit"
This reverts commit 35f1ec96be9e097247f13680acb4f62d6e63e538.
Revert "epson/qx10.cpp: use copyrozbitmap for (external to 7220) zoom handling"

12946: Add a skeleton for Shadow Warriors bootleg on Modular System [clawgrip]
New clones marked not working
-----------------------------
Shadow Warriors (Modular System) [Darksoft]

12948: Fix cue, toc, gdi parsers [987123879113]
For `parse_cue` and `parse_toc`: The last line of the file gets dropped because the code was checking for `feof` directly after
  doing a `fgets`, so if you have something like an INDEX command as the very last line without a newline at the end of the file
  then it would get dropped causing an error, or potentially an improper CHD depending on what data was dropped. The diff looks
  large for those parts but it's just because I changed the indentation level.
For `parse_gdi`: I rewrote the GDI parser to have a lot more sanity checks + just be more robust than before. Previously it would
  just trust that there were X number of tracks as specified in the first line of the file. If you change that to be a number larger
  than could be stored in `outtoc.tracks` then it would segfault. And if the file was blank it'd just cause chdman to get stuck
  compressing at nan%.

12949:  Add a skeleton for Double Dragon bootleg on Modular System [clawgrip]

Still missing one PROM, that was bad on the dumped PCB

12953: vt1682.cpp: various improvements for the Classic Max Pocket MX-10 and MX-11 sets (plus other units) promote to working
  [mamehaze]
machines promoted to working
-----------------
Classic Max Pocket PCMX11 - 12 in 1 Colour Games Console (horizontal, France) [David Haywood, AJR]
Classic Max Pocket Mx-10 - 12 in 1 (vertical) [David Haywood, AJR]
NJ Pocket 60-in-1 handheld 'X zero' (NTSC)  [David Haywood, AJR]
Portable Game Station 268-in-1  [David Haywood, AJR]
unknown VT1682-based 101-in-1 handheld (PAL) [David Haywood, AJR]
Toy Story 3 (Lexibook) [David Haywood, AJR]
- hook up a port to allow cmpmx11 to boot
- correct ROM mapping for cmpmx11 so all games can be selected
- add support for SoundCpu -> MainCpu interrupt request so that the SCU can request sample data when it needs it
- added guard against partial vector addresses being fetched which was causing crashes due to invalid IRQ destinations
- set the sound 6502 Stack Pointer to a known value on reset for cmpmx10 / cmpmx11 as the sound programs they upload don't set it
  and it was causing a huge amount of instability due to the stack corrupting critical data
- added support for an undocumented alt VRAM autoinc mode used by many of the games
- added rowscroll support (games using it work with the latest ALU fixes)
- updated logging in places
along with the ALU fix from AJR this brings many games on the units to playable state with sound, although a few still need work.

12954: t10mmc: Fix CD-TEXT detection, cdrom: Parse control flags from toc [987123879113]

12955: galaxian/galaxian.cpp: Add a (not working) new Jump Bug bootleg [clawgrip]

-----------------------------
Jump Bug (bootleg, set 3) [Arcadedealer aka Edgar Solé aka Dios, Recreativas.org]

12956: ap2_dsk.cpp: add read-only support for the D13 format [SpecLad]
This is the equivalent of DSK used for 13-sector disks.
While `diskiing` cannot directly boot from 13-sector disks, you can still access such disks with it (for example, using the BOOT13
  and MUFFIN programs from the DOS master disk), so list the format as supported by both `diskiing13` and `diskiing`.

12958: MIPS3 fixes for IDT-specific instructions [MooglyGuy]
This adds support for MAD/MADU in the interpreter, as well as fixing the implementation and disassembly of the MUL instruction. All
  are specific to the IDT R4650.

12959: Exposing full build version to LUA as emu.app_build [npwoods]

12972: Update trkfldch.cpp - add notes about where sample playback request is in abl4play [mamehaze]
the workings of the audio hardware for this SoC type are a bit of a mystery
I've at least isolated the 'play sample from ROM' call in abl4play which could be a vital starting point, so is worth making a note
  of in the driver for future reference

-metro/metro.cpp: verified some clocks for puzzlet [Guru]

-Thomson floppy disk updates [AJR]
 * to8, to9 & to9p now include the FDC in the base configuration. to9 uses a WD1770 (WD2793 appears to fail calibration), while to8
    & to9p use the THM-FC-1 gate array (now a separate device). This eliminates the need to, and ability to, configure floppy disk
    extensions for the to8, to9 and to9p.
 * Changed sector offsets for double-sided .fd images so that they load correctly (usually).

-emu/input.cpp: Guard against automatic integer promotion on arithmetic. [Vas Crabb]

-namcos23: remove texture_enabled flag, it caused missing graphics so this bit must have a different meaning, reset poly counts each
 frame to prevent trailing graphics and MAME crashing when holding INS [hap]

-machine/smioc.cpp: Cleaned up parameter bounds checking that could cause a compiler diagnostic. [R. Belmont]

-thomson.cpp: Overhaul all ROM definitions to correspond to actual ICs rather than logical banks. The sizes and hence hashes of
 virtually all files have changed due to being combined or split up. NO_DUMP entries have also been added for some known undumped
 PROMs. [AJR]

-Fixed dip switch hookup, added unpopulated buttons and updated IO port documentation on the Namco TSSIO JVS I/O board, based on
 hardware analysis by Guru. [smf-]

-apple/pseudovia.cpp: Split out the pseudo-VIA device used by RBV, V8, VASP, and Sonora. [R. Belmont]
 * This device was previously copy-pasted almost verbatim between those 4 devices, and it will be appearing in PowerBooks in the
    future as well.
   - apple/mac*.cpp: All 68020 and 68030 Macintoshes that didn't come with an FPU but were able to be fitted with one later now gate
      it behind a configuration switch. [R. Belmont]
 * You must completely exit out of the driver to for changes take effect.  This may be relaxed in the future.

-Fixed several things using memset on non-trivial objects. [Vas Crabb]
 * In particular, this fixes a delegate getting nuked in cpu/powerpc.

 indefinite. When this happens, a special message may be printed to the debug console stating the location of the last actual
 instruction executed before the wait (if there was one). [AJR]
 * Note that since the callback ignores the current value of the program counter, this special type of debugger break cannot be
    entered through breakpoints or instruction stepping commands. The callback also leaves no effect on PC history tracking or trace
    logs.
   - cpu/hd61700, cpu/tms32031: Add standard IRQ callback
   - cpu/m68000gen.py: Change name of invoked executable to bin/python3

-debugger/osx: Don't use uninitialised NSRect when creating pop-up button. [Vas Crabb]
 * The initial size doesn't really matter because the pop-up button is resized before being added to the container that holds it and
    the expression field.  The disassembly viewer apparently wasn't updated properly like the memory viewer when the auto-sizing
    code was refactored.
 * Hopefully this will fix the debugger crashing when restoring window positions from configuration (although I would have thought
    this would cause crashes in more situations if it was the cause of that).
