These drivers have improved SOUND:
----------------------------------

- Fixed sound in the Exidy games. [Aaron Giles]

- Improved YM2413 emulation. [Paul Leaman]


Source:
-------

- [DOS] The SEAL patch was bugged on mono sound cards, a new one is included.

- Fixed save_screen_snapshot() to save VIDEO_PIXEL_ASPECT_RATIO_1_2 games with
  the correct aspect ratio. Also introduced save_screen_snapshot_as(). Porters
  are STRONGLY ADVISED to use one of these functions to save screen shots,
  instead of providing their own. Note that osd_save_snapshot() now takes a
  bitmap argument, so it must not be hardwired to save Machine->scrbitmap
  (overlays wouldn't be saved otherwise). [nathan]

- A few changes were made to allow run time changes to the visible area, and
  to simplify the OS dependant code by moving some functionality to the core.
  - Added visible_area to struct RunningMachine. Drivers must now use
    Machine->visible_area instead of Machine->drv->visible_area. The field in
    struct MachineDriver has been renamed default_visible_area and it should
    normally be used by the core only.
  - New function set_visible_area() that can be used by drivers to change the
    active display area at run time.
  - New function osd_set_visible_area() used to tell the OS dependant code the
    portion of the bitmap that has to be drawn on screen. It is passed
    coordinates relative to the actual bitmap, so no further processing is
    required for rotated games. The OS dependant code is allowed to display a
    smaller portion of the bitmap if necessary, but it must not draw a larger
    portion (which might contain garbage).
    The function must call set_ui_visarea() to tell the core the portion of
    the bitmap which is actually visible (which might be smaller than
    requested), so the user interface can be drawn accordingly.
  - osd_update_video_and_audio() takes a bitmap parameter so must not be
    hardwired to draw Machine->scrbitmap.
  - New fields vector_width and vector_height in struct GameOptions. The OS
    dependant code must initialize them to force different resolutions for
    vector games. If left at 0, the default 640x480 is used.
  - osd_create_display() must no longer create the screen bitmap, this is done
    by the core. It must only create the display screen / window, and return 0
    on success.
    Note that the width and height parameters passed are now the dimensions of
    the visible area, not of the bitmap as they were before; therefore the
    function only has to create a screen / window of the requested size, without
    further processing, and without peeking into the drv->visible_area field.
    This applies to osd_set_display() as well.
  - Changed osd_new_bitmap() and renamed it osd_alloc_bitmap() to avoid
    confusion with old drivers. The function is the same as before but it must
    not swap width and height for vertical games - this is done by the core.
    osd_new_bitmap() and osd_free_bitmap() must not be called by drivers, they
    are reserved to the core. Drivers must call the equivalent bitmap_alloc()
    and bitmap_free() which take care of rotation for vertical games.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- The meaning of the full_refresh parameter to vh_screenrefresh() has been
  slightly extend. It usually means "don't make incremental updates to the
  screen bitmap, redraw it completely", however if the driver wants it can also
  mean "redraw all temporary bitmaps". This happens when using the functions
  below. This way, drivers doing lots of memset(dirtybuffer,1) can be
  simplified and schedule it just at the beginning of vh_screenrefresh.
- Added some functions that make flip screen handling a little more eloquent:
  flip_screen_x_w(), flip_screen_y_w(), flip_screen_w() to set the flip_screen
  bits, and 3 variables flip_screen_x, flip_screen_y, flip_screen to read them
  back. If the flipscreen changes, the funtions automatically set full_refresh
  to true for the next call of vh_screenrefresh.
  The functions also call tilemap_set_flip(ALL_TILEMAPS), so no further
  operations are required when using TileMaps.
  Finally, the functions also adjust the visible area, mirroring it, in case
  it is asymmetrical. For example, rockola.c relies on this.
- Also added 2 helper functions:
  - void set_vh_global_attribute( data_t *addr, data_t data )    This takes a
  pointer to any variable and a value, and sets the variable to the value.  In
  addition, if the value has changed, it sets full_refresh to true by calling
  the next function.
  - void schedule_full_refresh(void)   This just sets full_refresh to true for
  the next screenrefresh.  See vidhrdw/galaxian.c for examples on this and
  set_vh_global_attribute.
