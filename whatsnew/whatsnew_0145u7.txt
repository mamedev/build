Source Changes
--------------
m68k improvements: [Hans Ostermeyer]
 * Fixed BFINS, BFEXTU, and BFEXTS to fetch 8-bit quantities as 8 bits
   (corrects Domain/OS 10.3.5 crash on page boundry)
 * Added SoftFloat log functions and m68k FLOGNP1, FLOGN, FLOG2, and
   FLOG10 instructions

kinstb, ffight2b, iron, denseib, sblast2b (snesb.c) [stephh] :
 * Fixed Dip Switches and Coin Inputs (after verification of the 5A22
    code)

PGM, Scorpion 4/5 and Astra Fruit Machine  [David Haywood]
 * Slightly reworked some previous PGM submissions.
 * Reorganized many bfm_sc4/sc5 sound roms.
 * Added some notes, code and alternate revisions to astrafr.c.

nbmj8891.c: Fixed font graphics in hanamomo. [Takahiro Nogi]

uPD1990AC: Only latch CSx bits when STB is high. [R. Belmont]

proconn.c  [David Haywood]
 * Added the basic device definitions for this driver with some NULL
    callbacks for now, setting the framework for more progress later.

globalfr.c VFD improvement to allow for better debugging as well as
some rom splitting of clones for the driver.  Also did some stepper
motor work to support more types.  [James Wallace]

ecoinf3.c  [David Haywood]
 * Added some 8255s (maybe too many, not sure how many the PCBs have)
    and identified where it writes the 'VFD' strings.

silvmil.c: Added known dipswitches & locations. Derived clock speeds
from actual OSCs located on the PCB. [Brian Troha]

Revamped the sprite decryption of raiden2-like Seibu boards.
[Andreas Naive]
 * Added support for Zero Team.
 * Code refactored to clarify the algorithm.

Improvements to Jaleco's "Stepping Stage Special" [Luca Elia]
 * fixed memory maps, rom loading, added inputs
 * Hooked up sprites, hacked in the text layer
 * Can be made to boot using the debugger

icecold.c  [Sandro Ronco]
 * This game has mechanical parts so it's not exactly playable, but it
    is possible try it until the end giving the expected inputs.
 * Imported the i8279 device from MESS and updated to support sensor
    mode and mask nibble.
 * Made a simple layout and the defined input ports.

Improved the serial emulation in 68307 and added some logging,
removing the hack in bfm_sc4.c [David Haywood]

Meyco driver improvements: [Roberto Fresca]
 * Reworked Inputs for all games.
 * Added button-lamps support.
 * Created internal control layout for all games.
 * Added mech counters support.

 * Renamed the mdrawpkra ROMs based on PCB picture.
 * Renamed the driver to meyc8080.c
 * Added technical and game notes.

preliminary Imagetek I5000 sound emulation. [hap]

Started giving Scorpion games their own reel / key configs, which is
needed for most of them to pass their post / not hang on 'reel errors'
or infinitely spinning reels.  Also more work on 68307's. 
[David Haywood]

Converted turbo.c to use i8279 device [Sandro Ronco]

Added some better command handling to stop SC4 games from overwriting
their attract mode messages with garbage.  [James Wallace]

Preliminary work on Scorpion 4 lamps + more set resorting 
[David Haywood]

Discovered similarities in gotcha.c to Data East Bootleg sprites, also
happening to be the closest implementation to Silver Millennium in the
sources.  Refactored each based on this information.  [David Haywood]

Refactored a few things related to reels and use of layouts allowing
for more function with less work  [David Haywood]

CPS-3 update  [Team CPS-1]:
 * Fixed CD Catalog # for jojoba 990927 and properly renamed the chd
 * Realigned the games table

amaticmg.c: figured out encryption [Andreas Naive]

alternate DSW settings as found in scanned Pins & Dip manual.
[Brian Troha]
