Program:
- Yes!!  Finally I wrote a driver for Gyruss, one of my favourite games
  and one of the reasons why I started emulation.  Big special thanks
  to Michael Cuddy, without help and information this game would probably
  never be done;  and to Nicola Salmoria that fixed some of the sprites
  bugs that turned me mad and cleaned the code! ;)

- The following changes were done by Nicola Salmoria:
  - 1942 has correct colours.  Also fixed rom paging, so now it has no more
    slowdowns.  Fixed jerkiness.  Sound is better, too.  How about the
    tempo?  How about the pitch?  Are they right?
  - fixed missing sprites when exiting from doors in Elevator Action. There
    are still some sprite priority bugs.  Also better colors.
  - Thanks to Marc Lafontaine's invaluable help, Popeye is now fully playable
    and has 100% accurate colors.  Supports high score saving, too.
    Still very slow.

- Brad Oliver found a lot of bugs around the code.  Fixed 1942 background
  scroll, Arabian video driver, and Phoenix sound init routine (all those
  caused trashes on MAC).

- Paul Berberich fixed some colors of Donkey Kong that is now quite close
  to original arcade.  Also Donkey Kong Jr. has better colors now.

- Fabrice Frences provided a driver for Krull.  Also fixed some bugs in
  qbert, and returned audio to Mad Planets.

- Ron Fries created a new set of Donkey Kong samples, using Mike Cuddy's
  8039 emulator.  The new samples no longer have static, they are aliased
  and louder.  All names are now generic, so the same name can be used
  across Nintendo line (DK, DKjr, DK3, Mario).

- Chris Hardly kindly provided a working driver for Warp Warp.

- Dave W. provided a new set of invaders samples.  Should be better, though.

- Frogger music tempo bring back to original value.  Fast but flawless!

Sources:
- Changed 8910intf to support 5 PSGs (Gyruss have them!)

- Changes in MAME.C:  added -list option.  This is useful for mantaining
  the readme file.  It lists currently supported games.  Thanks to Zanello
  Maurizio for suggestion.

- Changes in MSDOS.C:  vesa and vesascan are now mutex.  Also fixed a bug
  caused by calling joystick initialize before starting allegro.

- To UNIX users:  sorry for the mess I did in my previous distribuition.
  All names and patches should be ok now.

- Nicola Salmoria provided the following changes:
  - changed GENERIC.C to add sound_command_latch_r(): this always return the
    last command, instead of 0, if there are no more pending commands. This
    was required by 1942.

  - new flag for the cpu type: CPU_AUDIO_CPU. For example, you'll define a CPU
    type as CPU_Z80 | CPU_AUDIO_CPU. This indicates that the CPU is a slave
    used for audio only, and is therefore not needed if sound is disabled.
    The CPU will not be emulated when sound is turned off, therefore speeding
    up the emulation a lot.

  - also, 8910_sh_update() doesn't emulate the 8910 audio if sound is disabled
    (the I/O ports of the chip are still emulated, since some games use them
     for input).
