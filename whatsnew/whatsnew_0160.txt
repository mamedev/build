- add basic hookups of internal peripherals to the V53, made it an actual
  CPU type derived from the V33.  Most of these have come from the PC emulation
  * DMA Controller (subset of uPD71071/uPD71037), clone of 8237A
  * Serial Controller (modified uPD71051), clone of i8251
  * Interrupt Controller (uPD71059 equivalent), clone of PIC8259
  * Timer Unit (identical to uPD71054), clone of pit8253
  [David Haywood]

- hooked up ROM banking to Hyper Neogeo 64 Sound CPU, this, along with the
