Source Changes
--------------
-srcclean now processes XML & C comments the same, so they can be
 indented but within the comment itself spaces are used. [smf]

-remove extraneous line continuation characters followed by a blank
 line and blank lines that follow an opening brace in c files. [smf]

-i8244.c: Added a device implementation for the i8244/i8245. 
 [Wilbert Pol]

-diimage: allow image devices to skip core fopen() of the image's
 filename and handle themselves in call_load() [R. Belmont]

-uimain.c: use slot interface names for filling current values in slot
 menu, because using command line options produces garbage at least on
 OS10.6.8. [Fabio Priuli]

-subsino.c: hopper emulation in stisub, smoto and clones [Luca Elia]

-DSP16: Additional opcodes & disassembly fixes.  [Andrew Gardner]

-n68681: fixed trashing of the serial parameters when ACR is updated.
 [R. Belmont]

-MIDI core updates: [R. Belmont]
  * Add MIDI in and out ports as image device types
  * Add OSD calls to check for and read MIDI input
  * Add MIDI in image device which reads input and converts it to a
    serial bitstream

-d3dhlsl.c: Made HLSL switchable at runtime, Ctrl+Alt+F5. [MooglyGuy]

-MIDI: allow input port to work without a connected real device [R. Belmont]

-First pass on MIDI out support [R. Belmont]

-DSP16 : Additional opcodes.  [Andrew Gardner]

-Hooked up lamps in Virtua Racing.  [SailorSat]

-Added a preliminary boolean flag to MC6845 interface structure: "show
 border area". If true, it will show the whole video area including
 border + blanking areas. [Angelo Salese]

-DSP16: The PC moves on from potentially all used opcodes now. 
 [Andrew Gardner]

-MIDI: Fixed several bugs and bumped the input buffer sizes [R. Belmont]

-Lucky'74 (set 2): Proper inputs to reflect the real payrate table. [Roberto Fresca]

-QT Debugger improvements.  [Andrew Gardner]
  * Fixed disassembly window not following PC correctly.
  * Switched font to Courier New since it seems more universal.
  * Fixed gaps between rendered text characters.
  * Plumbed mouse handling through the debugger core (clicking
    selects).
  * Made the Enter key behave like old SDL debugger; silently steps.

-wwfsstar.c: Correct rom loads for genuine PCBs sets and correct a few rom labels. 
 Added the bootleg set and documentation about it. [Brian Troha]

-wwfsstarj - correct program / tx tile roms [Stevebm1, Porchy]

-qix.c - Resolve device references at initialisation where possible [Phil Bennett]

-sharcdsm.c:  [Pavel Semerad]
  * Added omitted direction flags in instruction using both PM() and DM().
  * In instruction with 6bit immediate data, this data is signed value.
    It would be better to show this sign because it is confusing to
    see for example 0x3F which actually means -1 (32bit immed data are
    not confusing as that big values are easy to recognize).

-Bonne Chance!: Worked complete inputs from the scratch. Promoted to
 working. Added some notes. [Roberto Fresca]

-Bonne Chance!: Added proper palette. Now the game seems to get
 accurate colors. Also added some descriptive notes and instructions
 for the service mode. [Roberto Fresca]

    and R3081
  * Endianness is now specified by MCFG_R3000_ENDIANNESS() (default is
    big-endian)
  * Removed configuration struct. Cache sizes and FPU availability are
    now determined from the CPU type
  * Added state saving
  * Added BrCond input callbacks

-CPS-2 update [Team CPS-1]:
  * Fixed 3 labels in sfa2u
  * Reordered sfz2alj set

-psx: change the rendering back to quads as less people complained about the
 old graphical issues compares to the new ones [smf]

 Ryuko [hotgraphics, Song Gao, Bad A Billy, ranger_lennier, Yohji, Smitdogg,
 Charles MacDonald, The Dumping Union]

-psx: uses a devcb2 for cpu to cd controller communication, the address
 decoding is internal to the cpu & the cd controller is on it's own 8
 bit bus. [smf]

-m740: Correct disassembly for bit+zp+rel. offset form of BBC/BBS [R. Belmont]

-psx: Use devcb2 for cpu to spu hookup as it's on it's own 16 bit bus.
 Removed the spu hookup in taitogn at 0x1fa51c00 as it doesn't make
 sense, will wait for bug reports before investigating further. [smf]

-d3dhlsl.c: Add preliminary vector post-processing. [MooglyGuy]

 note counters, default NVRAM, and promoted to working...
 Note: To switch between pins/cards, after insert some credits (before bet on
 the game), press HOLD3 to get the graphics option, and use HOLD2 and HOLD4
 to choose the wished set. [Roberto Fresca]

-psx: clamp framebuffer reading to frame buffer coordinates. not sure this
 is accurate, but it stops it crashing when negative coordinates are
 used. [smf]

-ZN update [Team CPS-1]:
  * Confirmed 1 label in sfexu
  * Added a note in sfexa set

-QT Debugger improvements [Andrew Gardner]
  * Save and load window locations.
  * Preliminary work on "run and hide" and "hard reset" (don't crash on
    one of my copmilers but do on another - more work to do!)
  * Fixed color when cursor is the same as PC in debug view.
