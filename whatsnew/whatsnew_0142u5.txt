Source Changes
--------------
Fixed Final Arch failing the IC13 test [Angelo Salese]

Fixed Final Arch and Sando-R multi cart support [Angelo Salese]

Internal HLSL cleanup - removed aux texcoords, restored software
vertex processing due to low-end cards not doing hardware vertex
processing, removed unnecessary tristrip->trilist splitting. Restores
D3D functionality on integrated chipsets and marginal cards.
[Ryan Holtz, Ashura-X]

Dumped GFX / sound roms to Gigaman 2 [f205v, Smitdogg, The Dumping
Union]

Converted PlayStation GPU to a device [smf]

Added PORT_NAME to buttons to better illustrate actual use in Atari
System 1 and Atari G1 drivers.  [Tafoid]

konicdev et al.: Turn the 053250 into a modern device. [O. Galibert]

More accurate pixel clocks for Sega Saturn / ST-V [Angelo Salese]

Moved SCSP to main irq function into an external write line function,
fixes sound regression in Groove on Fight and Intro Don Don
[Angelo Salese]

ends [Oliver Stoneberg]

TMS52xx: Minor updates to the comments and the disabled-by-default
pulse excitation code to better match how hardware would probably
work. [Lord Nightmare, Neill Corlett]

HLSL Updates: [Ryan Holtz, Bat Country Entertainment]
 * Switched to point-sampling through most of the shader chain to
    avoid non-intentional pixel smearing
- Corrected alignment and scaling on the shadow mask and scanlines;
dramatically reduces rainbow banding at non-oversampled resolutions.

Fixed a rather silly bug with SCU DSP execute flag [Angelo Salese]

Moved SMPC intback command inside a timer, removes a kludge for SMPC
mask irq [Angelo Salese]

Changed name of sn76489 variant used in Sega Master System and
Megadrive/Genesis from SMSIII to the more technically accurate
SEGAPSG, as the PSG in question was not only used on the mark 3 units.
[Lord Nightmare]

Added accurate hblank durations to Sega Saturn / ST-V HW
[Angelo Salese, Corrado Tomaselli, Charles MacDonald]

ertictac/poizone: Greatly improved (not perfect) audio
[R. Belmont, Heihachi_73]

Switch SEGA System E to use the SEGAPSG sn764xx variant, as it uses
two SEGA 315-5124 VDPs which have the SEGAPSG integrated. Should
slightly improve sound. [Lord Nightmare]

Fixed Sega System E to use xtal.h, fixed mc8123 comment, clarified PCB
diagram, verified xtal for z80b. [Lord Nightmare, Charles MacDonald]

Added HD6345 CRTC-II variant to mc6845.c. [Curt Coder]

idectrl - implemented verify no retry command [Carl] 

i86 - Fixed imul instruction [Carl]

Low-level input upgrade. Classes now exist for input_codes,
input_items, input_devices, and input_seqs. Also created an
input_manager class to hold machine-global state and made it
accessible via machine.input(). Expanded the device index range
(0-255, up from 0-16), and the OSD can now specify the device index
explicitly if they can better keep the indexes from varying
run-to-run. [Aaron Giles]

HLSL Updates:
[Ryan Holtz, Bat Country Entertainment, austere, SoltanGris42]
 * Added the ability to render screenshots at arbitrary resolutions.
 * Added the ability to record AVI videos (albeit with no audio) at
    arbitrary resolutions.
 * Added a 43-tap-wide FIR-based NTSC filter with tunable Y, I and Q
    frequency response.
 * Updated scanlines to have a user-tunable pixel-height ratio in
    addition to the current screen-height ratio.
- Fixed a VRAM leak that was causing many dynamic-resolution drivers
  to run out of memory mid-run.

Implemented IRQ callbacks for the mc146818 RTC [Carl]

Fixed UNSP CPU core reset [Robbbert]

Fixed POP, POPF, PUSHF, and flags for V20 core [Carl, Alex Jackson]

[O. Galibert]

memory: Make the proxy manage a list of handlers instead of a unique
one. [O. Galibert]

memory: Add a handler copy function which works on subunits-only
handlers. [O. Galibert]

memory: Finally allow different handlers on different subunits of the
same address. [O. Galibert]

memory: Implement depopulate_unused().  [O. Galibert]

pic8259 - Fixed edge triggering and non-specific EOI
[Carl, Miodrag Milanovic]

Added SKIT_F0 opcode to the uPD7801/uPD7810 CPU core [Angelo Salese]

drawd3d.c into a couple of headers.

nec disassembler - Only display "byte/word ptr" when it's actually
needed to resolve ambiguity (same as the i386 disassembler)
[Alex Jackson]

Add ROM dump from motor drive board for Sega Touring Car Championship
[RetroRepair]

Hooked up the 2 PPI8255 for Super Crowns Golf [Angelo Salese]

emuopts: added confirm_quit option (defaults to off). when on,
pressing ESC you are prompted with a 'confirm quit' screen rather than
directly quit emulation. [MamePlus Team, Mamesick, Fabio Priuli]

i86: fix initial CS on reset [Alex Jackson]

memory: Change the gc into a refcounter, for speed reasons.
[O. Galibert]

Fix inverted check on anonymous timers prior to saving state. Also fix
bug where we fail to ignore the permanent non-expiring anonymous
timer. Added code to log timers, and we now log them at each save
attempt as well as at restore time. Should fix most recent save state
releated regressions. [Aaron Giles]

Started to work on Neogeo ROM naming, mostly removal of .bin extension
in favour of chiplabel.socketlabel convention [Johnboy]

Added echo emulation to the OkiM6376 sound chip [J. Wallace]
