9311: 8080bw.cpp: added colors emulation to vortex [Mike Coates] [Osso13]
I was sent this code. The colors seem strange to me, but the blurry, low resolution pics seem to confirm them. Opening a PR since

9605: osd/modules/input: Detect joystick reconnection with SDL [cuavas]
This is the most obvious approach to detecting game controllers being reconnected with SDL.  The trouble is, it behaves badly on
  Windows SDL builds.
The GUIDs are not unique on Windows – they just contain the bus type, vendor ID and product ID padded out with zeroes.  This means
  that on Windows, it can’t distinguish between similar controllers being added.  For example if you have more than one of the same
  kind of controller attached to a hub, and you disconnect and reconnect the hub, the joysticks may come back with different
  assignments.  This is possibly worse than just not detecting reconnected controllers.  SDL 2.0.14 includes a
  `SDL_JoystickGetSerial` function, but I don’t want to bump the required SDL version up that high right now.
It does seem to work acceptably on Linux with udev.
I don’t see a simple way to detect SDL’s joystick driver to just avoid trying to handle reconnection on Windows (I could be missing
  something, though).  Perhaps it’s best to just go ahead with it anyway – most people on Windows don’t use `OSD=sdl` at this point,
  and we can still tell people not to count on controllers working if they’re reconnected.  It would be good to get some feedback
  from Mac users on what it does there, though.
This also changes the display names for joystick items with SDL:
* Numbers buttons, axes and hats from 1 rather than 0 – it’s more natural and matches the labels on plain HID gamepads
* Gets rid of the SDL device name from absolute and relative axes – this seems to be a vestigial thing from when baseline MAME
  didn’t always include logical device names for joystick controls
* Displays X/Y for relative axes rather than just numbering the Y axes one higher than corresponding X axes

9622: spectrum_cass.xml: Added one game and a couple of demos [ICEknigh7]
Just noticed that the only way to play the Spectrum version of Inspector Gadget was through its Russian bootleg arcade game
  "Brodjaga", so I added its only official release (was cancelled in the UK but released in Spain).
Also added a couple of demos that I found laying around in a very old backup, and which aren't already included in any cover tapes:
-LSD Megademo
-The Ren and Stimpy Slideshow (a slideshow with a few, crappily scanned, black and white pics but with a nice presentation)

9623: a2600.xml: Fix publishers; mark generalr/westward clones of custer [einstein95]

9624: 8080bw.cpp: Re-remove cocktail inputs from spaceat2/sinvzen [einstein95]
This resolves one of the issues @cuavas brought up in #9149 

9625: osborne1.cpp: revert floppy device back to SSDD [theoldsport]
Partially reverts an old commit from @Robbbert (https://github.com/mamedev/mame/commit/247939853301565efd348cad12b04fc957707bc2)
  where the floppy device was (mistakenly?) set to FLOPPY_525_QD (quad density) from FLOPPY_525_SSDD (single-sided double-density).
As far as I am aware, the Osborne1 only supported SSSD and SSDD disks. Revert appears to resolve known Osborne1 issues 5792 (thanks
  to @Osso13 for pointing this out) and 8100 @cuavas.

9626: Refinement to MIPS3 EXTRA_INSTR_CHECK change; reduces perf loss on unaffected machines [MooglyGuy]
-mips3drc: Moved unchanging conditionals outside for loop in generate_checksum_block. [Ryan Holtz]

9628: bus/nes: Updated Jaleco boards. [0kmg]
- JF-13: fixed simultaneous samples playing at boot of Moero Pro Yakyuu.
- JF-16, discrete 74x161: set hardware-valid one-screen mirroring mode at reset.
- JF-17/19: Streamlined by putting common details in base class. Fixed latches which switch banks on low to high transition. Demoted
  moejudo since it's not playable.
- SS88006 boards: Also streamlined everything into common base class. Parameterized common code patterns. Added WRAM enable bits.
- nes.xml: Corrected ROM sizes of undumped uPD775xC chips.

9629: Addressed performance loss from recent z80scc changes [MooglyGuy]
-z80scc: Removed unused Z80SCC_USE_LOCAL_BRG and simplified WR15_ZEROCOUNT usage to reduce the likelihood of needless timer
  activation. [Ryan Holtz]
-mips3drc: Additional micro-optimizations to generate_checksum_block. [Ryan Holtz]

9630: Only ACK correct I2C device-id [Paul-Arnold]
i2cmem devices incorrectly ACK all device-ids, not just their own.
Devices based on i2cmem.cpp also do the same.
If they're not selected they also leave the data line low whereas it should be high.
Please note that this fix will probably break any driver which has multiple I2C slave devices on the same bus and combines their
  data lines by OR'ing them together. They should be AND'ed.

9632: JPM SRU fruit machine improvements [SomeRandomGuyIdk]
Many improvements to the JPM SRU fruit machine driver to bring it out of skeleton state. Four games are now playable, 
albeit with very barebones layouts. There are some games from the skeleton which I haven't looked at yet that I'll 
deal with later. I've also found ROMs for a few more games, those are to be added soon.
Changes:
- Many changes to the JPM SRU driver, 4 games now playable
- SRU audio circuit netlist, not yet perfect
- Very simple layouts for the games with proper symbols on the reels, also changed jpmsru.lay
- Added JPM SRU reels to steppers.cpp
- Created machine/genfruit.cpp, a common class with mechanical sound samples for fruit machines (same idea as genpin.cpp)

9633: xavix2: Fix scaling of background in ltv_naru [qeeg]
Any further fixes to the title screen will require better CRTC emulation.
This fix was found by realizing that the background, which was the only part that required scaling to match hardware, was the only
  sprite in the list with w and h in the command set to 0x20 instead of 0x10. Guessing that this was some sort of scaling factor
  turned out to be fruitful.
After the change:

9687: vegas.cpp: Fix reversed DIP switch names for sf2049te, sf2049se [neSneSgB]
The disk-based test was booting to the EPROM-based test and vice versa. For both games, the DIP switch meanings in the EPROM-based
  test and in the disk-based test are not the same; they contradict each other.

9688: Update megadriv software list to add optional region protection information [csvowles]
Some Mega Drive/Genesis ROMs are region protected, when the game starts in a console from an incorrect region then they either
  display a message (explaining the Cartridge is designed for a different region), or they fail to boot or hang (which is the case
  for many Konami games, which hang showing the KONAMI white splash screen), or they can run to some extent but not enough to be
  playable.
This enhancement to the megadriv software list documents the region protection cases using the optional "compatibility" value for
  338 ROMs.
The valid options are:
`NTSC-U` for North America/Brazil - `<sharedfeat name="compatibility" value="NTSC-U"/>`
`NTSC-J` for Japan/S Korea/Asia - `<sharedfeat name="compatibility" value="NTSC-J"/>`
`PAL` for Europe (including France SECAM variant, and Australia) - `<sharedfeat name="compatibility" value="PAL"/>`
ROMs can be valid in multiple regions, for example:
`<sharedfeat name="compatibility" value="NTSC-U,NTSC-J"/>`
or
`<sharedfeat name="compatibility" value="PAL,NTSC-U"/>`
Many ROMs work in all the regions, and if there is no `sharedfeat name="compatibility"` value set for that ROM in the softwarelist
  then it is valid for all three console regions.
A comment against the value categorises which of the following the region restriction is:
* `Region Locked`  - a message is displayed explaining that the game has purposely been prevented from running on this region of
  console (the message is not always correct, sometimes more or less regions are actually available)
* `Region Incompatible` - game does not boot on incorrect region, it may be intentionally region locked but no message is displayed
  before it hangs
* `Region Issues` - runs to some extent on a console from an incorrect region, but the game is too broken to be playable
This change on its own will just document the Sega Mega Drive region coding situation.
A code change to Mame could actually prevent a rom that will not run on a particular console region from being listed as available
  to the machine, such as https://github.com/mamedev/mame/pull/9620.

9692: ibm5150.xml: PC Booter corrections [Allofich]
The ibm5150.xml list divides games into a "Booter Games" section and a "DOS-based games" section.
The following games are in the "Booter Games" section but are not PC Booter games (they give a "non-system disk" error if you try to
  run them that way. They can be run through DOS). This PR moves them to the "DOS-based games" and removes the PC Booter usage line
  from those that have it.
**Hacker
Sex Vixens from Space

The following games are PC Booter games but are missing the PC Booter usage line, so this PR adds it for them.

9694: acia6850: initialize receive section [mmicko]
Leaving this uninitialized, caused WIP driver to randomly respond to serial terminal when driver is started.

9699: cps2.cpp: Added TOURNAMENT board communication simulation. [cuavas]
Thanks to Darksoft for tracing the board, and @originalgrego for producing a proof of concept implementation.
To use this, enable communication in the Machine Configuration menu for four instances of `ssf2tb` or a clone, and then daisy-chain
  them using the various `comm_*` options.  The `comm_remotehost` option for the head of the daisy chain must be empty.  For
  example, to run them all on one machine:
* mame ssf2tb -comm_localhost 0.0.0.0 -comm_localport 1234 -comm_remotehost ""
* mame ssf2tb -comm_localhost 0.0.0.0 -comm_localport 1235 -comm_remotehost 127.0.0.1 -comm_remoteport 1234
* mame ssf2tb -comm_localhost 0.0.0.0 -comm_localport 1236 -comm_remotehost 127.0.0.1 -comm_remoteport 1235
* mame ssf2tb -comm_localhost "" -comm_remotehost 127.0.0.1 -comm_remoteport 1236
The TOURNAMENT board apparently can generate interrupts, but the game doesn’t seem to mind if it doesn’t – it still polls the USART.
  This is all simulated at a very high level due to the way MAME only synchronises with the wall clock once per frame – on a typical
  PC, the main thread is sleeping over 90% of the time when running a CPS2 game.  Trying to do it more realistically would require
  major changes to MAME’s event loop.
The games will lose sync pretty quickly if they aren’t running at the same speed (e.g. if you try to fast-forward one of them).
  I’ve had it lose sync once with normal play, but it seems to work fairly well most of the time.

9710: Notes/typos + note changes for DDR Karaoke [simzy39]
-The bottom of the driver says '"Dance Dance Revolution Karaoke Mix (GQ921 VER. JBB)"'
which is hard to deduce as being 'DAM-DDR Dance Dance Revolution for DAM' at the top of the driver.
As such, I've changed it to: "Dance Dance Revolution Karaoke MIX (DAM-DDR)" and "Dance Dance Revolution Karaoke MIX 2nd (DAM-DDR)"
  based on what I've found on the internet. This name appears to be accurate, at least for the system. The game disc itself doesn't
  contain the name DAM.
A few sources:
https://remywiki.com/AC_DDR_Karaoke
https://bcaweb.bai.ne.jp/miyooo/ddrd.html
-: In the list, there is a 'P' next to these names, denoting 'plain System573', but according to my first source:
DDR KAraoke "...uses a modified System 573, equipped with four video input/output and a DAM karaoke device."
As such I've changed the P to 'K' and have changed Kick and Kick's letter, which was a K, to AA since it's a similar board to the A.
A: uses ext. analog I/O board GX700-PWB(F)
AA: uses alt. ext. analog I/O board GX700-PWB(K)

9718: r4000.cpp: Add TimerIntDis mux to IPEX5 [briceonk]
This change implements boot-mode setting bit 19, TimIntDis/TimerIntDis, which configures if the R4x00 will use IPEX5 as an external
  interrupt, or as an internal timer using the compare register as the threshold (which is the default). The Sony NEWS NWS-5000X has
  multiple external timers, including a free-running clock and a hardware clock that drives IPEX2. So, Sony disabled the internal
  timer using TimerIntDis and repurposed IPEX5 for other things.

This is another change pulled in from #8854 since that PR is way too big. Apologies for taking so much time to restart the process
  of breaking it up into smaller, easier to review portions. The first part of the year is the build and competition season for the
  robotics team I mentor, so I had essentially no free time....

9728: Additions and changes to Spectrum-related softlists [ICEknigh7]
**specpls3**
Spectrum disk version of Comando Tracer has been verified to be the standalone release, so its entry was changed.
Added list of known undumped games and other observations.
**spectrum_cass**
Added two demos and a good dump.
-Shock Megademo (Known dump on the internet was in TAP, so I created this TZX from the "SHOCKSAVER" program in the covertape for
  Sinclair User 85)
-The Lyra II (Full version, as opposed to the one split across several covertapes)
-Diseñador de Juegos (Microbyte): Replaced bad dump with verified one
**timex_cass**
Added a list of the known covertapes of "Byte Power, 1st Class Magazine" as well as the only known dump.
-Byte Power (February 1988)
**timex_cass and spectrum_cass**
Detected some games published by TMX Portugal but which were actually made for the Spectrum, so I moved them to the latter's
  softlist.
-Assalto A Embaixada (was already in both)
-Interface RS232 (now duplicated in both softlists, since the cover mentions both systems)
-Perigos Na Selva (replaces bad dump already in Spectrum softlist)
-Programa de Apresentação
-Space Raiders - Invasores Galácticos (replaces bad dump already in Spectrum softlist)

9745: [powervr2.cpp] Naomi Rendering Fixes [DragonMinded]
This fixes a few miscellaneous rendering bugs with Naomi1/2 that I noticed while trying to debug my doom port in MAME. 
1. Hooks up non-textured sprite rendering. Not sure why this was excluded (aside from UV stuff not applicable?) since all code
  worked just fine on hooking up. Without this fix, the boxes behind the next/previous instructions at the bottom of this test code
  do not appear. With this fix, they appear matching hardware. Also, with fix 2 below they properly render translucently (I don't
  have any photos of this but I did test on actual HW, demul and MAME and saw them all working identically).
!boxes
3. Fixes the "enable alpha" bit to enable alpha on base/offset color, with the alpha set to full when unset, and hooked up "disable
  texture alpha" to disabling texture alpha instead of "enable alpha". This fixes hardware-assisted font rendering in all of my test
  code and appears to match demul and actual HW. Note that I think this fix will probably fix a lot of the black pixels instead of
  alpha issues seen on various Naomi games, but I didn't test. I only compared test binaries that I've previously verified on demul
  and actual HW.
Before the fix:
!before
After the fix:
!after
I still don't know why MAME won't properly render my doom port, but the behavior points at incorrect handling of interrupts and I
  will try to fix that and submit another PR.

9747: Fix address mask for SST 39SF040 [mmicko]
This fix running a tool to update flash as on original hardware in my WIP driver.
Before this was failing since it was entering part of code where address is masked but mask was zero
!0000

9748: slapfght.cpp: Hooked up flip screen output to MCU for alcon and slapfigh [cuavas]
This makes the flip screen DIP switch and cocktail mode work for alcon and slapfigh.  It already worked for slapfigha which uses the
  same latch output as the other games for this purpose.  Screen flipping still doesn’t work in the bootlegs, but that could well be
  a real limitation as they lack the MCU (the bootleggers may have been too lazy to hook screen flipping up a different way).
The graphics still have offsets, but at least the offsets look the same between normal and flipped mode now.

9749: Revert "Add udp multicast support" [cuavas]
Reverts mamedev/mame#9744

9752: netlist: Resolve #8590 and fix #r73625467 (#9751), add tests [couriersud]
- Fixes compile with apple clang 10
- fix standalone vs 2019 build
- PMF now working properly in VS due to addition of static stub.
- Align syntax in ppmf to MAME delegate.h
  There is one use case in netlist using the protected object function.
  Once this has been removed, netlist can optionally be compiled with
  MAME delegate code.
- Add tests/test_ppmf*.cpp testing examples given in #8590

9767: fix version detection in str_to_version for versions formatted as (n).(n)-suffix [sairuk]
This fixes version detection in  `str_to_version` where the version include a type suffix like `-posix`. Windows cross-compilation
  is currently broken on linux. The currently `x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -dumpversion` returns `10-win32` on Ubuntu 22.04. Since this
  version doesn't contain a `.` char it fails the `string.gmatch` in `str_to_version` resulting in a `0` return. We then fall into
  into
the version check block at `genie.lua` ln:1063
https://github.com/mamedev/mame/blob/afb0469e485d19671cfbff48969daea030918917/scripts/genie.lua#L42
https://github.com/mamedev/mame/blob/afb0469e485d19671cfbff48969daea030918917/scripts/genie.lua#L1063
falling into this block results in `os.exit(-1)` that presents to the user as:
 `make: *** [makefile:1105: build/projects/windows/mame/gmake-mingw64-gcc/Makefile] Error 255`
This change also makes version numbers reported consistent with those where a `-suffix` is not present
```
version:  10-posix   old:  0       new:  100000
version:  10-win32   old:  0       new:  100000
version:  9.3-posix  old:  90000   new:  90300
version:  9.3-win32  old:  90000   new:  90300
version:  11         old:  110000  new:  110000
version:  10         old:  100000  new:  100000
version:  9.3.0      old:  90300   new:  90300
version:  9.3        old:  90300   new:  90300
version:  11.2       old:  110200  new:  110200
version:  11.2.0     old:  110200  new:  110200
version:  6.0        old:  60000   new:  60000
version:  6          old:  60000   new:  60000
version:  7.3.4      old:  70304   new:  70304
version:  8.7        old:  80700   new:  80700
```
e.g where `9.3-win32` used to report `90000` it now reports `90300` which is consistent with what is reports for `9.3` and `9.3.0`

9768: rc2014 code review fixes [mmicko]

-ksys573.cpp: Notes/typos + note changes for DDR Karaoke (#9710) [simzy39]
 * The bottom of the driver says '"Dance Dance Revolution Karaoke Mix (GQ921 VER. JBB)"' which is hard to deduce as being 'DAM-DDR
    Dance Dance Revolution for DAM' at the top of the driver. As such, I've changed it to: "Dance Dance Revolution Karaoke MIX
    (DAM-DDR)" and "Dance Dance Revolution Karaoke MIX 2nd (DAM-DDR)" based on what I've found on the internet. This name appears to
    be accurate, at least for the system. The game disc itself doesn't contain the name DAM. A few sources:
    https://remywiki.com/AC_DDR_Karaoke https://bcaweb.bai.ne.jp/miyooo/ddrd.html
 * : In the list, there is a 'P' next to these names, denoting 'plain System573', but according to my first source: DDR KAraoke
    "...uses a modified System 573, equipped with four video input/output and a DAM karaoke device." As such I've changed the P to
    'K' and have changed Kick and Kick's letter, which was a K, to AA since it's a similar board to the A. A: uses ext. analog I/O
    board GX700-PWB(F) AA: uses alt. ext. analog I/O board GX700-PWB(K) K: uses karaoke I/O board GX921-PWB(B)
 * 'DDR max' and 'DDR max 2' to 'DDRMAX' and 'DDRMAX2'

The House of the Dead (Revision A) [egregiousguy]

-seta.cpp: added hardware info for Caliber 50 [Guru]

-snk.cpp: added hardware info for Ikari Warriors [Guru]

-netlist: Fixes to address PR #9752 and issue #8590 / EMSCRIPTEN (#9773) [couriersud]
 * netlist: pointer to member function code
   - Address PR #9752 and issue #8590
   - change comments in ppmf.h
   - add support for function desciptors (IA64)
   - sizeof(size_t) may be different on build targets make plib::hash use uint64 to ensure consistent static solver hashes across
      platforms (EMSCRIPTEN)
   - Moved constructor and member functions outside the class declaration with the exception of "call" member functions.
   - Updated comment on accessing RDX
   - Added more test cases
     * Removed execution bit on certain files I have separated out the raw processing code into `ppmf.cpp`. I have also taken first
        steps to clean the abi identification.
       - The code submitted now supports:
       - a) The unknown virtual inheritance case with specific code for MSVC for simple (i.e. scalar, void, reference, pointer)
          return types using the optimized code. This is the test case only supported under MSVC and which should return 7. Please
          have a look at the code. Basically m_vptr_offset is an index into a pointer table. It needs to be multiplied by
          `sizeof(void *)`.
       - b) If you enable PPMF_EXPERIMENTAL complex return type member functions for MSVC will also use the optimized code path.
          This is explained in detail in the code in ppmf, including caveats and possible solutions.
       - c) Enabling PPMF_USE_MAME_DELEGATES will use `src/lib/util/delegate.h` as a replacement for `ppmf.h`. This allows to run
          the same tests (`nltool -c tests` from standalone build) as for the ppmf code.
       - d) The code now also supports `clang-cl`
       - e) sizeof(size_t) may be different on build targets.
       - Make plib::hash use uint64 to ensure consistent static solver hashes across platforms. This fixes loading static solvers
          (if enabled) on EMSCRIPTEN.

-Updated Commodore LCD colors, based on recent pictures from one of the prototypes. [smf]
 * Fixed Commodore LCD real time clock reading, it relies on the RTC chip being able to ground PORT A while it is set to an output.
    Which is documented in the 6522 datasheet as being possible. It's NMOS, so it has weak pull ups and doesn't drive it's output
    hard. However due to a bug in the prototype ROM code, it currently has the date and month swapped round. [smf]

-3rdparty/portmidi: Fixed windows MIDI callback signatures. (#9781) [Devin Acker]

-spdheat.cpp: Demoted to MACHINE_IMPERFECT_SOUND. (#9779) [eientei95]
