 callbacks from configuration as the values are pushed already [smf]

-Changed victor9000 keyboard to push the data line to the 6522 [smf]

-removed IEEE488 CA1/CA2 callback as it already pushes the values [smf]

-Removed cb2 callback from mac drivers, you now have to push the data. [smf]

 signals. Rewrote switch2 device to be based on resistances as well.
 [Couriersud]

- AVR8 cpu changes [Felipe Sanches]
 * timers wip
 * Add TIMSK* reads - Refactor timer_tick calls
 * Remove all redundant register init statements. We simply set all
    0x200 registers to zero.
 * debugging timers
 * better syntax for disassembly of RJMP destination address
 * use register names in disasm of CBI, SBI, SBIC, SBIS instructions
 * use register bit names in disasm of instructions SBI, SBIS, SBIC,
    CBI
- wip on avr8 EEPROM read/write support

-Remove code obfuscation, please don't revert my changes without
 discussing it first. [smf]

-Started to remove via port read handlers, prematurely stopped because
 IEEE488 code derives the clock from the read handler being called [smf]

-Removed port read handlers from wicat as they just return what was
 written [smf]

-Netlist: [Couriersud]
 * fixed 7474 save state
 * remove a printf
 * simplified netlist_list_t
 * increased reschedule count to 15 - diodes are dog-slow
 * made reschedule count a solver parameter
 * simplified solver code
 * solver time now also resets

-removed the simplest 6522 port callbacks [smf]

-fd_fdc: Fix the FM sync detection [Michael Zapf]

-Modernised VIC20 user port [smf]

-Hooked up the 6551 to the plus 4 user port, haven't been able to test
 it in diag264 as cartridges don't appear to work [smf]

-n68681: modernized and killed config struct in favor of devcb2. [R. Belmont]

-Allow vic20/c64/c128 to share user port devices, removed c64 version
 of vic1011 and moved protovision 4 player adapter from bus/c64 to
 bus/vic20. Tried to test with
 http://code.google.com/p/commodore-multi-player/ as it supports
 protovision 4 player adapter, but it currently crashes. I have had to
 disable 1541 as it prevents quick loading from working. [smf]

-Fix for pixel gaps between multi-screen games in HLSL mode. [MooglyGuy]

-Merged pet/vic20/c64/plus4/c128 user ports, the pinout is slightly
 different on each one but there are cards that are compatible with
 each of the different machines. [smf]

-Added user port pinout from CBMII manual [smf]

-Fixed commodore quick load by passing in the address space instead of
 using machine().firstcpu [smf]

-Added PET user port joystick adapter [smf]

-segas32.c: Added alien3 and darkedge readmes. [Guru]

-Netlist: [Couriersud]
 * added missing parameter to analog input device
 * parser now parses NET_MODEL
 * fixed a bug in switching bjt implementation

-Fixed noise period on AY8910. [Dr. Venom, Couriersud]

-Prevent clock bit to be deleted after CRC in FM. [Michael Zapf]

-Use proper AY8910 mixing model for MSX. Volumes set to match MSX
 hardware. [Dr. Venom, Couriersud]

 * added numeric keypad on Master series.
 * fixed CAPS LOCK and SHIFT LOCK.
 * removed dipswitches from Master series.
 * improved dipswitch descriptions.

-Naomi/Triforce documentation update [f205v]

-Converted PIA6821 to DEVCB2 [smf]

-Netlist: [Couriersud]
 * Added Ebers-Moll BJT model. Currently only for NPN.
 * Fixed convergence issue in the solver.
 * Accuracy for Ebers-Moll must be better than 1e-5 to not generate
   nano-second spikes. Typical sound applications should be able to run
   with less since the spikes are not audible.

-Removed 6821 porta_r/portb_r/ca1_r/ca2_r/cb1_r/cb2_r functions as they
 only returned what you'd written to the chip, only a couple of those
 were ever used (by audio/exidy.c). Removed some ca*/cb* read callbacks
 that just returned what had already been pushed or always returned 0.
 As there are no longer any cb2 read callbacks that functionality has
 been removed. [smf]

-reduced the number of callers to set_a_input by calling porta_w & made
 the WRITE8_HANDLER call that as well, instead of the other way round
 and having to lookup an address space that is never used [smf]

-tlcs90.c: Modernized cpu core.  [Wilbert Pol]

-Removed calls to mpu4_state *state =
 machine.driver_data<mpu4_state>(); by moving code into mpu4_state.
 Removed runtime lookup of devices that were already looked up in
 mpu4_state. [smf]

-docastle.c: hook up slave CPU IRQ according to schematics
 [Alex Jackson]

-Added a "-listdevices" option to nltool to list all available devices.
 Simplified code. [Couriersud]

-It makes more sense to mask out the errors that are going to be
 brought in from the error mask rather than throw all the other bits
 away. However I haven't seen any documentation for Z80DART that says
 there is an error FIFO at all. [smf]

-fixed Z80DART parity selection [smf]

-Removed hack and hooked up Z80DART now that parity works. [smf]

-preliminary patches for Donggul Donggul Haerong [ElSemi] (still
 doesn't work, but at least boots now)

-likely the correct patch, game still doesn't work [ElSemi]

-i8251: as per the manual, disabling Tx mid-byte should wait for
 transmission to finish [R. Belmont]

-call set_data_frame() before calling set_rcv_rate() as otherwise it
 acccesses m_synchronous before it is set leading to random behaviour
 [smf]

-v810.c: Modernized cpu core.  [Wilbert Pol]

-Added write_sense to S2650 CPU and use it for pipbug serial port,
 Hunchback (Galaxian Hardware) and replace calls to set_input_line(1 in
 lazercmd.c & meadows.c [smf]

-Replaced FLAG fake IO port with a DEVCB2 callback [smf]

-Added an RS232 port instead of hard coding the serial terminal [smf]

-Added preliminary sound to thunderlbl. Unsurprisingly seems to share
 the same hook-up as wiggie and superbon, the other thunderl hacks in
 the driver. Marked as IMPERFECT_SOUND cause the music keeps restarting
 after a few seconds after inserting a coin. Seems fine during
 gameplay, though. [Osso]

-Fixed compiling with Visual Studio 2012 [smf]

 Added the correct, half-swapped dump of cpu_pg5.11 to spyhunt/spyhuntp
 [Porchy]

-Implemented near-to-proper reset for all netlist devices. Reset now
 works for improved matrix solving. [couriersud]

-Added 82s153's from Ropeman (Roc 'n Rope bootleg) and also corrected
 the rom names and locations.  In addition, corrected some of the names
 of the one United States Donkey Kong Jr. set.  [Kevin Eshbach]

-converted to use RS232 port instead of hard coded to using serial
 terminal [smf]

-Removed some dead code and ambiguous functions in the netlist code.
 [Couriersud]

-Introduced the concept of "logic families". Currently, standard
 devices default to TTL. Going forward, this enables the family type
 (e.g. LS, S, HCT, ...) to be a device parameter. Currently, no changes
 are introduced. This is architecture work. [Couriersud]

-Created a mame sound device for netlist. Fixed an issue causing wild
 oscillations. Currently, pong has sample code for using the sound
 device. Uncomment "TEST_SOUND" in pong.c to hear a constant sound from
 a 7400 multivibrator. Sound is still WIP, but the proof of concept has
 been done. [Couriersud]

-Changed parity & stop bits to an enum (you can now pass in 1.5). I've
 updated the uarts that were testing for 1.5 stop bits to pass that in,
 but there are probably others & 1.5 stop bits is converted to 2 by
 diserial. However the 68681 requires stop bits to be specified in
 clocks, so this will change in the future. Replaced synchronous flag
 with start bit count, as some uarts can use a start bit in synchronous
 mode & that whether there is a start bit is all the flag is currently
 controlling. Updated rs232 terminal to allow startbits, stop bits 1.5
 to be specified (although that is currently not supported by diserial)
 and individual transmit and receive baud rates. [smf]

-Added music and save states to bmcbowl. [Osso]

-Added music and save states to koftball. [Osso]

-tms9927: Added VSYNC callback. [Curt Coder]

-SDL: Temporarily restore compatibility with Qt versions below 4.7.
 [R. Belmont]

-add proper internal rom to 'svg' parent set, it resets on coin now,
 need to investigate [rtw, iq_132, David Haywood]

-tms5501: Rewrote the emulation to use devcb2 and diserial. [Curt Coder]

-flopimg: Added preliminary support for the 8-N-1 serial encoding
 scheme used on Compucolor II floppies. [Curt Coder]

-diserial: Added framing error detection. [Curt Coder]

-Netlist: [Couriersud]
 * Working Ebers Moll model. That's a significant step ahead.
 * Simple 2x2|RHS SPICE stamps now supported by two terminal devices.
    This was implicitly contained in the design, but set_mat now shows
    how a two-terminal device fits into a SPICE approach.
 * Introduced direct solvers for net groups with 1 or 2 nets.
 * Introduced specialized solvers for N=1,2,3,4,5 by using templates.
 * nice performance increase for BJTs

-fixed bad graphics in donghaer [ElSemi]

-n68681: Implement OP3 toggle on timer expire and input delta
 interrupts. [R. Belmont]

-moved contents of .inc into .c to removed #define pollution when
 including h6280.h [smf]

-converted z80 to c++ [smf]

-Added support for 8 bit data transfers using the set features command,
 instead of using mem_mask as ATA doesn't work that way. [smf]

-added a hack for mametesters 05256 [smf]

-replaced more machine().firstcpu with m_maincpu [smf]

-replaced some calls to machine().firstcpu->pcbase() with
 machine().describe_context() [smf]

-don't change the current bank on reset, because another device might
 have already changed the bank when it was reset [smf]

-Fix wrapping in KERN/APPL/RAM mode by moving TEST map to the next
 address bit. [smf]

-Added unknown encrypted Royal Card. This game is running on Dino 4
 encrypted hardware, with a CPU+PLCC daughterboard. Decrypted pro- gram
 address + data, but code still jumps into $48xx range where there's no
 valid code. Decoded and partially decrypted the graphics set.
 [Roberto Fresca, ANY]

-n68681: make loopback operate at the current baud rate instead of
 instantaneously.  Fixes dectalk DUART self-test. [R. Belmont]

-z180.c: Modernized cpu core.  [Wilbert Pol]

-Added support for shift out free running at t2 rate, cb1 output now
 lasts for the specified number of clocks and the signal goes low at
 the end. [smf]

-Try to match the colors from the most recent photograph
 http://vivaamigafilm.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/chillin-with-porter.html [smf]

-Created a character font rom with upper and lower case characters
 using the upper case font in the kernel rom as a starting point [smf]

-renamed lcd char rom to match this photo
 http://www.floodgap.com/retrobits/ckb/secret/cbm-vlcd-charrom.jpg &
 replaced lower case y with one that better matches this screenshot
 http://www.floodgap.com/retrobits/ckb/secret/cbm-lcd-screen.gif [smf]

-6522 CA1 is input only, so I have removed the output callback. The
 lisa via hookup has been changed as it had functions named as CA2/CB2
 hooked up to CA1/CB1 and CA1 output no longer exists, it appears to
 have been wrong since before the code was merged with MAME. Changed
 CB1 to be active low as CA2 & CB2 already are & it sort of was before,
 but when the chip is reset then the handlers are called setting the
 lines to 1. This seems to stop it thinking that you've pressed a key
 at startup as I believe it got out of sync before because the lines
 weren't consistent. Merged some duplicate code for handling outputs
 and removed some obvious comments. [smf]

-tourvis.c: Correct 1 cart name and add newly dumped U4-43 BIOS.
 [The Dumping Union]

-Converted MSM58321 to DEVCB2, uses level logic rather than edge
 detection for strobes (as per datasheet), added nvram interface as
 there are some configuration bits to save, added support for 12 and 24
 hour. It defaults to 12 hour, but you can configure it in the driver
 to default to 24H. You can configure what year 0 is in the driver,
 which is used when setting the date at startup. [smf]
 
-Allow reading from port A in output mode. Add a separate bit for timer
 1 PB7 toggling rather than changing the PB register directly. Don't
 clear the SR register on reset. Clears pcr & acr at construct time, in
 case something sets one of the handshaking lines before we've started.
 Use a separate variable for the latched inputs and the current inputs.
 Consolidated the input and output code. [smf]
 
-sharc.c: Modernized cpu core.  [Wilbert Pol]

-Hooked up RTC. There are several issues. The day and month register
 are swapped. Even though it allows you to select between 12/24H the
 RTC is always saved in 24H mode and it always defaults to display in
 12H mode. [smf]

-Clears port a and port b latches at startup, temporarily reverted CA1
 timing change as Beezer is extremely sensitive to CB2 timing,
 temporarily prevented port a read handlers from affecting reading back
 of output bits (real hardware can do this but some handlers are
 returning 0 for bits that they aren't driving low). [smf]

-Added SCREEN_RAW_PARAMS to Express Raider, fixed screen size to
 256x240 [Angelo Salese]

-z8000.c: Modernized cpu core.  [Wilbert Pol]

-m6502: expose SYNC pin through devcb2 for more flexibility [R. Belmont]

-tugboat.c: correct AY chip type and clock, some cleanups [Alex Jackson]

-AICA: EFREG is mapped every other word, not every word.  Fixes memory
 trashing in all Naomi/DC/AW games. [O. Galibert, R. Belmont]

-resolves the user port handlers in device_config_complete() & replaced
 calling reset() on user port with toggling of input line 3 as not all
 computers have reset hooked up on the user port. I believe
 device_reset() will always be called, which makes the call in the
 drivers machine_reset() unnecessary. [smf]

-changed name to "PET user port" as that is where it originated and
 reformatted the source file [smf]

-qix.c: Let's not regenerate the entire palette every time we do a
 partial update [Alex Jackson]

-mos6551: support Rockwell 6551s, which show different register
 contents from MOS/CSG parts on reset. [R. Belmont]

-nemesis.c [Alex Jackson]:
 * Hooked up RC filters to AY8910s
 * Fixed konamigt layout aspect ratio
 * Some corrections to address maps and inputs

-popeye.c: added RC filter (MT 3726), cleanups [Alex Jackson]

-Stop the flipping insanity [Alex Jackson]

 Tilemap flipping is now calculated relative to the center of the
 visible area rather than to the total screen size, and the generic
 flip screen functions no longer reconfigure the actual screen. These
 changes ensure that in most cases flipping should Just Work for
 drivers that use MCFG_RAW_PARAMs, games that have a programmable CRTC,
 and games that have raster effects, and should fix many longstanding
 flip/cocktail-related regressions.

-Added Bingo (1983). PCB seems bootleg, but the game looks legit.
 Worked from the scratch a whole set of inputs and button-lamps support
 for this game. Changed the poker41 description to Four in One Poker
 (as seen in the official brochure). Added game and technical notes.
 [Roberto Fresca]

-Improvements to Unknown Royal Card on Dino4 hardware: [Roberto Fresca]
 * Fully decrypted the graphics set.
 * Added technical notes...

-Added Bingo PCB layout and technical notes. [Roberto Fresca]

-Fix rallybik title screen color [Alex Jackson]

-toaplan1.c: remove sound reset hack, unify gfx decoding, various
 cleanups [Alex Jackson]

-redumped 317-0024 (FD1089B) used by Time Scanner [Charles MacDonald, ShouTime]

-twincobr.c: fix flipscreen after core changes, cleanups [Alex Jackson]

-updated documentation [Charles MacDonald]

-added some more documentation to the discrete skeletons. [gregf]

-Centronics WIP using write lines and DEVCB2. Added an output latch and
 input buffer device to allow configuration in MCFG. Renamed centronics
 device "printer" to "image". FM-7 parallel port joystick works again.
 Added support for using PC LPT control lines as inputs (not tested).
 c64 geocable now just passes individual lines through, changed the
 strobe line to what is documented online (not tested). Converted MSX &
 exidy sorcerer parallel port DAC to use covox device instead of using
 a configuration switch (not tested). Sorcerer parallel port is more
 like the commodore user port, so should be converted to it's own slot
 where one option is a centronics card. [smf]

 digits in UPC-A, EAN-13 and EAN-8 format, stores them in both byte
 format and in pixel format; it is up to the driver to implement the
 correct transfer protocol. [Fabio Priuli]

 driver and decode properly the first graphics bank, since graphics are
 encoded/packed in a different way. This game has the main rate fixed
 to 40%, and coins A+B fixed with 100 credits by pulse (maybe used as
 remote credits inputs).

-bking.c, toypop.c: fix flipscreen after core changes [Alex Jackson]

 [Roberto Fresca]

-Declaring indirect colors in MCFG is now mandatory. Removed dynamic
 creation and resizing of indirection tables [Alex Jackson]

-Added device_output_interface and macros
 MCFG_OUTPUT_INDEX/MCFG_OUTPUT_NAME which can be used to specify which
 output in the layout a device should use. [Curt Coder]

-CPS1.c:  Willow, Strider and Ghouls and Ghosts have some changed
 factory setting defaults as stated from manual.  Also noted
 differences in bonus live coverage where applicable.  [Tafoid]
 
-omti8621: Converted to proper ISA card [R. Belmont]

 plugged it into the Husky Hunter 2 driver. [Barry Rodewald]

-Removed unselectable slot options (SLOT_INTERFACE_INTERNAL) from the
 listxml output. [Curt Coder]

-Add an osd_truncate call to truncate files [O. Galibert]

-Moved core template container classes up from emutempl.h to coretmpl.h: [Aaron Giles]
 * these classes now no longer take a resource_pool; everything is
    managed globally -- this means that objects added to lists must be
    allocated with global_alloc
 * added new auto_pointer<> template which wraps a pointer and
    auto-frees it upon destruction; it also defaults to NULL so it
    doesn't need to be explicitly initialized
 * moved tagged_list template to tagmap.h
 
Redo of the low-level memory tracking system: [Aaron Giles]
 * moved low-level tracking out of emu\emualloc into
    lib\util\corealloc so it can be shared among all components and
    used by core libraries
 * global_alloc and friends no longer use a resource pool to track
    allocations; turns out this was a wholly redundant system that
    wasted a lot of memory
 * removed global_resource_pool entirely
 * added global_free_array to delete arrays allocated with
    global_alloc_array
 * added tracking of object versus array allocation; we will now error
    if you use global_free on an array, or global_free_array on an
    object

 modern techniques (no more MAX_DRIVERS in makelist, for example).
 [Aaron Giles]

-Deprecated auto_strdup and removed all uses by way of caller-managed
 astrings and the software list rewrite. [Aaron Giles]

-Rewrote software list management: [Aaron Giles]
 * removed the notion of a software_list that is separate from a
    software_list_device; they are one and the same now
 * moved several functions into device_image_interface since they
    really didn't belong in the core software list class
 * lots of simplification as a result of the above changes

    PAINT, DOT, PTN, GCPY commands
 * added pattern RAM emulation

-wd_fdc: Refactored to use devcb2 callbacks. [Curt Coder]

-Rewritten 6551 emulation. Changed clock to be the o2 clock instead of
 the baud rate xtal, supports external clocking, generates transmit
 interrupts when idle, added echo mode, dcd/dsr/cts input handling,
 parity & stop bit checking. Tested and fixed hookup to commodore lcd &
 plus 4. [smf]

-offtwall.c:  Corrected the rom names and locations of the upright
 version of Atari's Off the Wall and also added a dump of one of the
 GAL's (a GAL16V8A-25LP) on the boardset which was the only one without
 the security fuse blown.  [Kevin Eshbach]

-upd765: Refactored to use devcb2 callbacks. [Curt Coder]

-Made gfx_element::decode() private; fixed drivers that were calling it
 directly [Alex Jackson]

-added proper IC locations to tmnt2 sets [Ben76]

-added Korean? tile rom to newly dumped Shanghai3 set [Brian Troha]
 (was present on the board, but unused in our sets? probably for use
 with undumped Korean program roms and leftover from conversion)

-h63484.c compile fix [external] 

-added compile time check for 64-bit intel compiler to delegate.h
 (to prevent assert(sizeof(mfp) <= sizeof(m_rawdata)); ) [external]

-Made an attempt to fix the banking of MPU4 games, this isn't perfect,
 but most non banked games will now run. [J. Wallace]

-littlerb.c: Fill in missing dipswitch settings and add dipswitch
 locations to Little Robin. [Brian Troha]

-SDL: Next stage cleanup, aligned texture conversion with current
 Windows/D3D code, and fixed overzealous GL texture caching.
 [R. Belmont]

-render.c: clean out dead, broken code accidentally revived by palette
 rewrite. Allocate brightness/contrast/gamma-adjusted palettes on first
 use, since we can't allocate them at startup anymore due to init order
 issues [Alex Jackson]

-tms5110r.inc: updated tms5110 to use newer chirp table, based on decap
 [Lord_Nightmare, digshadow]

-315_5124.c: improved X-Scroll register timing. [Enik Land]

-netlist: Nice performance increase by removing logic terminals from
 net if they are inactive. Introduced a linked-list class to abstract
 linked-lists. Fixed deactivating devices. You have to enable this
 because it is not guaranteed to be timing-exact. [Couriersud]

- N64 RSP changes: [MooglyGuy]
 * Added SIMUL_SIMD flag for easy finding of bugs in SIMD opcodes
 * Fixed SIMD versions of SSV, SLV, SDV, STV, VSUB, VADDC, VSUBC, and
    VGE
 * Removed SIMD optimizations from VMACF, VMADL, VMADN, as they were
   provided by the CEN64 author but do not appear to have the same
   results as MESS's scalar implementations, and so are not trustworthy

 and findings after some analysis. [Roberto Fresca]

-Move destructor definitions out of header files included by emu.h;
 clean some obsolete junk out of machine.h [Alex Jackson]

-gfx_elements now have a xor mask that is applied to each source bit
 offset when decoding. This can be used to deal with endianness when
 decoding gfx from RAM or from program ROMs, or to reverse the bit
 order sense when this is useful (e.g. pgm.c) [Alex Jackson]

-mc6845: Added display enable and horizontal/vertical back porch widths
 to the update function. Updated some MESS drivers to make use of this.
 [Curt Coder]

-4enlinea: Adjusted the initial screen parameters according to the HCGA
 controller programmed registers and improved the way the graphics are
 drawn. Now the text is readable. [Roberto Fresca]

-4enlinea: Hooked a status handler for the HCGA controller. (for now,
 simulating the state). Improved the memory map fixing the RAM amount
 and offset, and added the correct offset for the HCGA status. Also
 hooked 2 debug handlers on ports e000-e001 that spit some random
 graphics after 30 seconds of the game execution (clue to figure out).
 [Roberto Fresca]

-Moved MPU4 Test Program 4 to the MOD4 driver, still needs some work on
 the timing though. Fixed Gamball reel positioning, this will need more
 work to standardise. [J.Wallace]

-quickjac: added inputs. [Sandro Ronco]

-namco23: Spring cleaning, including: [O. Galibert]
 * remove a bunch of s23 prefixes/suffixes useless since the
    OOification

 500gp now show something (completely wrong) [O. Galibert]

-namcos23: Enhance matrix-vector mul [O. Galibert]

-Added support for horizontal 'belt' reels which may be needed for
 future AWP titles. To invoke, add an attribute "beltreel" to the reel
 element in the layout, and set it to 1. [J. Wallace]

-h8: Add the h8/3008 [O. Galibert]

-Double Crown: Added button-lamps support, coin in and coin out
 counters, MAX693 watchdog reset, minor input fixes, and added
 technical notes. [Roberto Fresca]
