IDE controller now support two slots, currently used devices are made
as slot devices [Miodrag Milanovic]

Namco System 21/2 changes: [Phil Bennett]
 * Writing a C148 IRQ priority register now clears the prior interrupt
    state (required by dirtfoxj and winrun)

    code.
 * Scalemode is no longer a per-window setting

 * Use SDL_GetClipboard (SDL2.0)
 * Updated README_SDL20.txt
Currently, SDL 2.0 is only supported on *nix. Volunteers welcome.

Various N64 stability fixes. [Ryan Holtz]

Steel Talons: Fixed controls and removed the MSP speedup hack which
was causing the game to reset at certain points. [Phil Bennett]

NMK16 priority fixes [Raiden II Project Team]

N64: Partially fix PIF access, several more games recognize cart
SRAM, cart FlashROM, cart EEPROM, and controller paks [Ryan Holtz]

68040: Fix for fsave opcode [O. Galibert]

Added support for (track)balls to osd/sdl. [Couriersud]

Fixed testkeys to work with SDL2.0. Keymaps can now contain SDL1.3 and
SDL2.0 mappings. Updated km-de.txt as an example. [Couriersud]

Major CHD/chdman update: [Aaron Giles]
 The CHD version number has been increased from 4 to 5. This means any
 diff CHDs will no longer work. If you absolutely need to keep the
 data for any existing ones you have, find both the diff CHD and the
 original CHD for the game in question and upgrade using these
 commands:

 rename diff\game.dif diff\game-old.dif chdman copy -i
 diff\game-old.dif -ip roms\game.chd -o diff\game.dif -op roms\game.chd
 -c none

 Specifics regarding this change:

 Defined a new CHD version 5. New features/behaviors of this version:
  * support for up to 4 codecs; each block can use 1 of the 4
  * new LZMA codec, which tends to do better than zlib overall
  * new FLAC codec, primarily used for CDs (but can be applied
     anywhere)
  * upgraded AVHuff codec now uses FLAC for encoding audio
  * new Huffman codec, used to catch more nearly-uncompressable blocks
  * compressed CHDs now use a compressed map for significant savings
  * CHDs now are aware of a "unit" size; each hunk holds 1 or more
     units (in general units map to sectors for hard disks/CDs)
  * diff'ing against a parent now diffs at the unit level, greatly
    improving compression

 Rewrote and modernized chd.c. CHD versions prior to 3 are
 unsupported, and version 3/4 CHDs are only supported for reading.
 Creating a new CHD now leaves the file open.  Added methods to read
 and write at the unit and byte level, removing the need to handle
 this manually. Added metadata access methods that pass astrings and
 dynamic_buffers to simplify the interfaces. A companion class
 chd_compressor now implements full multithreaded compression,
 analyzing and compressing multiple hunks independently in parallel.
 Split the codec implementations out into a separate file chdcodec.*

 Updated harddisk.c and cdrom.c to rely on the caching/byte-level
 read/ write capabilities of the chd_file class. cdrom.c (and chdman)
 now also pad CDs to 4-frame boundaries instead of hunk boundaries,
 ensuring that the same SHA1 hashes are produced regardless of the
 hunk size.

 Rewrote chdman.exe entirely, switching from positional parameters to
 proper options. Use "chdman help" to get a list of commands, and
 "chdman help <command>" to get help for any particular command. Many
 redundant commands were removed now that additional flexibility is
 available. Some basic mappings:

 Old: chdman -createblankhd <out.chd> <cyls> <heads> <secs> New: chdman
 createhd -o <out.chd> -chs <cyls>,<heads>,<secs>

 Old: chdman -createuncomphd <in.raw> <out.chd> .... New: chdman
 createhd -i <in.raw> -o <out.chd> -c none ....

 Old: chdman -verifyfix <in.chd> New: chdman verify -i <in.chd> -f

 Old: chdman -merge <parent.chd> <diff.chd> <out.chd> New: chdman copy
 -i <diff.chd> -ip <parent.chd> -o <out.chd>

 Old: chdman -diff <parent.chd> <compare.chd> <diff.chd> New: chdman
 copy -i <compare.chd> -o <diff.chd> -op <parent.chd>

 Old: chdman -update <in.chd> <out.chd> New: chdman copy -i <in.chd> 
 -o <out.chd>

 Added new core file coretmpl.h to hold core template classes. For now
 just one class, dynamic_array<> is defined, which acts like an array
 of a given object but which can be appended to and/or resized. Also
 defines dynamic_buffer as dynamic_array<UINT8> for holding an
 arbitrary buffer of bytes. Expect to see these used a lot.

 Added new core helper hashing.c/.h which defines classes for each of
 the common hashing methods and creator classes to wrap the
 computation of these hashes. A future work item is to reimplement the
 core emulator hashing code using these.

 Split bit buffer helpers out into C++ classes and into their own
 public header in bitstream.h.

 Updated huffman.c/.h to C++, and changed the interface to make it
 more flexible to use in nonstandard ways. Also added huffman
 compression of the static tree for slightly better compression rates.

 Created flac.c/.h as simplified C++ wrappers around the FLAC
 interface. A future work item is to convert the samples sound device
 to a modern device and leverage this for reading FLAC files.

 Renamed avcomp.* to avhuff.*, updated to C++, and added support for
 FLAC as the audio encoding mechanism. The old huffman audio is still
 supported for decode only.

 Added a variant of core_fload that loads to a dynamic_buffer.

 Tweaked winwork.c a bit to not limit the maximum number of processors
 unless the work queue was created with the WORK_QUEUE_FLAG_HIGH_FREQ
 option. Further adjustments here are likely going to be necessary.

 Fixed bug in aviio.c which caused errors when reading some AVI files.

Fixed an issue with text being missing in some Aleck 64 games. [Ryan
Holtz]

Reduced memory usage in the N64 driver. [Ryan Holtz]
Hook up 64DD RTC and interrupts in the N64 code. [Ryan Holtz, kammedo]

Added warm reset support to N64 hardware [Ryan Holtz]

Fix -romident to work with .7z archives [David Haywood]

Added new CHD codec: CD-FLAC which knows how to shuffle CD data to
more optimally use FLAC. Updated flac wrapper to implement a tell
callback so FLAC can tell us how much we've decoded. Updated chdman to
use CD-FLAC codec in preference over the existing codecs for CDs by
default. [David Haywood]

Fail initializing the CD-FLAC codec if the hunk size is not
CD-compatible. [Aaron Giles]

Centralize detection of existing output files. Add detection (require
--force) for extracted files as well. Move checks outside of try/catch
so that the files are not subsequently deleted. [Aaron Giles]

Move all-0 detection to the write path. Use hunk_info on the
compression path to detect whether the write went through. [Aaron Giles]

Changed sample pack names for alphamc07 -> equites and aristmk4 ->
3bagflvt to match up sample to an actual setname.  [Tafoid]

dma8237: fix uninitialized variable [Hans Ostermeyer]

mc146818: remove previous Apollo hack, fix 32768 Hz. updates
[Hans Ostermeyer]

m68k: fix FSGLMUL/FSGLDIV plus some minor MMU improvements
[Hans Ostermeyer]

m68k: slightly less stubby CINV [Hans Ostermeyer]

namcos23: documentation update [Guru]

vamphalf.c: Added correct speed up to Diet Family [Dave Haywood]

Assorted N64 SP/DP/CPU comms accuracy fixes. [Ryan Holtz]

Rewrote SAMPLES as a modern device. Updated all callers. FLAC reading
is now done using the FLAC wrapper. There is now a samples_iterator
class to centralize the logic for handling the sample list walking.
[Aaron Giles]

Redid the cheesy half-baked votrax device since it relied on some
old samples-based handling. Until we have a real implementation, it
would be good to route the various clients through the current one to
at least wire it up properly, even if it just plays samples in the
end. Will look into that shortly. [Aaron Giles]

Added windows implementation of pseudo tty access functions over pipes
[Carl]

Fixed N64 RDP to not try to render a triangle with no spans.
[Ryan Holtz]

Sega Model 2 update: [Brian Troha]
* Dumped and hooked up Dynamite Baseball
* Dynamite Baseball 97 renamed as dynabb97
* Properly renamed 4 MASK ROMs in dynabb97 to match pcb manual
* Minor cleanups and fixes
