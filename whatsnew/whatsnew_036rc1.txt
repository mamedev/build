0.36 RELEASE CANDIDATE 1

A few drivers which didn't strictly fit MAME's purpose have been removed.
First of all there were a few drivers which, just like consoles or computers,
don't fall into the category of "arcade video games" that MAME attempts to
emulate. They should have never been added in the first place, and that mistake
is now being rectified.
One of the removed drivers is Street Fighter Zero for the CPS Changer, which
is not an arcade game even if it runs on arcade hardware. The source is left
in, commented out, because it could be useful as a reference for people
attempting to emulate CPS-2 (which, before you ask, won't happen anytime soon).
The so-called "home" versions of NeoGeo games have not ben removed because
there isn't anything in them suggesting that they are home-only games: they
accept coins just like all the others, and might just be different revisions
of the code.
Other removed drivers are four gambling machines. Note that a "gambling
machine" is different from a "video game with a gambling theme". The
discrimination is strictly a technical one, not a moral one (a gambling
machine gives back money/tokens/tickets, a video game does not).
The "Sente diagnostic cartridge" has not been removed because, even if it is
not a game, it is equivalent to the diagnostic tools that are built-in in many
other games - it's just that instead of pressing a service switch you had to
insert this special cartridge to test the board.
The last driver removed is Pong, which at this point was too much of a
simulation and too little of an emulation. It didn't really fit into MAME's
architecture which is CPU-based and targeted at accurately reproducing the
gameplay of the original.

That was a difficult decision to make, but thankfully I won't have to bother
about these things anymore in the future. Gotta go now! *waves*

Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] -hotrod selects a more appropriate button configuration when NeoGeo
  games are played. [Paolo Fiorani]

- The coin/start buttons are slightly changed. NOw they are layed out this way:
  1,2,3,4 -> start 1,2,3,4
  5,6,7,8 -> coin 1,2,3,4
  9,0,-,= -> service coin 1,2,3,4

- Preliminary support for HISCORE.DAT. [Phil Stroffolino]


Source:
-------

- 65sc02 and 65ce02 cpu cores. [Peter Trauner]

- [DOS] Compiled with Allegro WIP 3.9.31.

- Rewritten the Pokey emulator for greater accuracy. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Preliminary SN76477 emulation. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Fixed a rounding error in IPF_CENTER handling which caused problems with
  Centipede. Note, however, that it would be advisable to not use IPF_CENTER
  at all for trackball/dial inputs, since this is probably not how the
  hardware works in reality.
  For the same reason, also removed the "clip" parameter from the
  PORT_ANALOG() macro. Incidentally, this fixed Peek-a-Boo. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Lots of CPU fixes and cleanup. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Struct GfxLayout can now be parametric on the size of the memory region
  it refers to. This way the same gfx definition can be used for games with
  the same layout but different number of tiles. See drivers/m72.c,
  drivers/dec0.c for usage examples. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixes and improvements to the 6800 family emulator. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- Improvements to the YM2151 emulator. [Jarek Burczynski]

- Only one of the two YM2151 emulators is linked, this is determined at compile
  time. The default is Jarek's, which is more accurate though a little slower.
  It can be replaced with Tatsuyuki's changing the makefile.
