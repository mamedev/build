-Improved controls for Landing Gear, Hyper Bishi Bashi Champ, and Salary Man Champ. [sjy96525]

-Update for Brazilian Portuguese [Wellington Uemura]
 * All translation updated to follow GNOME Translation Rules for Brazilian Portuguese, this are the same rules for other Linux
    Distributions, Manuals, etc. Now we can avoid translation conflicts. http://br.gnome.org/GNOMEBR/ErrosFrequentes
    http://br.gnome.org/GNOMEBR/GuiaDoTradutor
 * Brazilian Portuguese REQUIRE context, it doesn't matter what a word say, we need to see what the program is doing instead of what
    the word/phrase is saying to construct the phrase correctly.
 * That ROM AUDITION functions means nothing in Brazilian Portuguese, so the translation was adapted to "Condição", this reflects
    better if the ROM is GOOD/BAD, etc.
 * OK has different meanings in Brazilian Portuguese, if you ask someone if the food was good and you reply "OK", it means that the
    food  are between good and bad or more or less. Since "Ok" doesn't reflect if the ROM is good or not, the translation was
    changed to "BOA" witch means "GOOD" following Brazilian Portuguese concordance rules "Estado dA ROM" this "A" tell us to use
    "boA" (female) instead of "BOM"(male).
 * Some parts of the translation was also adapted to fit the screen or the space the phrase is at.
 * To our language, the correct translation to plugin is plug-in.
 * A few more mistakes were fixed like Enter (to type in) = Digite not "Entre" (to get inside of) or Search = Pesquisa not "Busca",
    etc.

-prodigy: Basic LAY to SVG XSLT filter, should probably live somewhere else [Joakim Larsson Edstrom]

-et3400: Add reset key [AJR]

-weststory: verified sprite data by converting original mask rom into bootleg format and figuring out what was scrambled from there,
 it's a very simple but quite stupid bitswap on 2 of the roms.  made a note that one byte actually differs in the bootleg even after
 this, since it's been verified on 2 bootlegs it could be the original mask rom has a bad byte in it instead, should really be
 checked. [David Haywood]

-et3400: Add "Segment Test" input [AJR]

-cdi.cpp: decapped and dumped quizard3 MCU [Team Europe]

-Update MAME French translation [SSTSylvain]

-Update for Brazilian Portuguese [Wellington Uemura]
 * Minor fixes and typos. Added @felipesanches requests Shorted some strings as @felipesanches requests, not all "IU" was changed
    because it breaks the interface or is too big. We will have to deal with the "parent" and "clone" thing later, maybe the use of
    RAMIFICAÇÃO (RAMIFICATION OF) that will better reflect with our Language.

-fixing/improving metadata on CoCo FDCs: CP-450 and CD-6809 [Felipe Corrêa da Silva Sanches]
 * Thanks to Daniel Campos & Datassette.org for the CP-450 disk rom. MAME was calling it CP400_FDC, but the correct name of the disk
    controller unit is "Prológica CP-450". The ROM was correct (verified checksum), but I renamed it to fix the previous naming
    mistake. Unfortunately this FDC unit is rare, so I still don't know whats the IC reference for the EPROM on the PCB.
 * There is a photo of the CP-450 disk controller unit at: https://datassette.org/softwares/tandy-trs-color/cp-450-basic-disco-v-10

 * tell igs036 emulation to use uploaded tables for kov2nl / orleg2 [David Haywood]
 * use sprite decryption keys uploaded by games where we have internal rom [MetalliC, David Haywood]
 * ICRW sim improvements [MetalliC, Lord Nightmare]
 * memcard reader now uses image_device stuff, cards can be inserted / removed and get saved.  As each game/region requires a valid
    default card in order to save the default cards are now part of romset. [Metallic, David Haywood]

-Atmel AIC: rewrite logic at the level enough for pgm2. [MetalliC]

-igs036crypt.cpp
 * Updates to support kof98umh. [Andreas Naive]
 * The format of the key tables is now compatible with the real ones provided by the internal ARM. [Andreas Naive]

-igs036 CPU seems to be derived from a 946 type core based on using MPU not MMU, change it to be such. [David Haywood]

-Update strings.po (#2875) [theheroGAC]
 * Translations added or modified
 * ----------------------------- Italian

-fmtowns: even better horizontal scrolling [r09]

-twinkle: Changed RF5C400 clock to match board notes in driver. [smf] twinkle: Added 8mb of dummy ram to the RF5C400 and adjusted

 [smf, Guru]

-route16.cpp: added player 2 inputs to T.T. Mahjong [Angelo Salese]

-[compc.cpp, pc10iii] Added BIOS v4.35c and matching char ROM [rfka01]

-fmtowns: fixed 16-bit color scrolling a bit more [r09]
 * After further testing, it seems Vain Dream uses the horizontal adjust registers in 16-bit color mode for a small part of the
    intro, and PR #2881 made it slightly worse. This should make both it and psydet5 display correctly.

-segae.cpp: Correct ROM labels for Hang On Jr. [ShouTime]

-HLE of HP9845 internal printer (#2884) [fulivi]
 * hp9845 & hp64k: fixed breakage caused by c46e1007a8

-gba: add various mirrors and fix byte-wide VRAM/PRAM/OAM access. [R. Belmont]

-RF5C400: Converted to use device_rom_interface [smf]

-Rewind feature and RAM savestates. [vadosnaprimer]
 * This starts the work requested in #2398.
 * How RAM states work.
 * Implemented using util::vectorstream. Instead of dumping m_save.m_entry_list to file, it writes them as binary to vectorstream.
    Compression is not used, as it would slow down the process. The header is written as usual, also in binary. When a state is
    loaded, the savestate data gets binary-read from vectorstream.
 * How rewind works.
 * Rewind is optional, it can be turned off through MAME GUI while not running. Rewind capacity is available there too. Rewind step
    hotkey is available from the standard hotkey menu. In the debugger you have the "rewind" command ("rw" shortcut) that works the
    same as the hotkey.
 * Every time you advance a frame (pause step), rewinder captures a RAM savestate of the frame you were at. It does the same when
    you do step into/over/out in the debugger. Every time it captures a new state (and when you unpause), it marks as invalid all
    its states that go after the current machine time, because input might change, so they are not relevant anymore. It keeps their
    buffers allocated though, for future use. When rewinder runs out of allowed amount of savestates it can have, it invalidates the
    first state in the list and tosses its unique_ptr to the end of the list, then it uses its buffer to capture a new state. When
    you hit the rewind step key, or use "rewind" command in the debugger, it loads a state that is immediately before the current
    machine time. Invalid states between valid ones are not allowed to appear, as that breaks rewinder integrity and causes
    problems. Rewinder keeps its own set of ram states as a vector of unique_ptr's. All rewinder operations and errors get reported
    using machine().popmessage().

-icount was missing from the savestates [vadosnaprimer]
 * When you load a state, icount (*icountptr) would remain whatever it was before loading, messing with the remaining cycles and
    with the amount of code executed per run() call. This introduced non-determinism and badly influenced usage of savestates while
    debugging. machine().time() would also return wrong values after that, since it adds remaining cycles.

-explain the rewind command in debughlp fix a typo in the stateload description [vadosnaprimer]

-RF5C400: State save the external memory registers. Move static variable into device state. Fix the commented out osd_printf_debug.
 Fix "always values". Added skeleton for reading and writing channel register 0x0F (which is used by the beatmania IIDX games).

-trs80m2kb.cpp: Added missing keyboard controller rom [Edstrom, Sean Riddle]
 * I sent my fried (don't ask) 8021 trs80m2 keyboard controller to Sean who decapped it (see
    https://seanriddledecap.blogspot.se/2017/12/blog-post_8.html) and visually dumped the bits and after fixing a few bit errors the
    rom now runs in MAME without crashing. I disabled the keyboard device again as there are issues with 8021 emulation, there are
    some 8021 specific instructions that seems to be unemulated at this point: https://i.imgur.com/P5gIySR.png and there are more
    work to be done to replace the generic keyboard in the trs80m2 driver.

 [JoakimLarsson]

-Driver for HP2645A terminal Hi, [fulivi]
 * this PR introduces the driver for HP2645A terminal. It's still WIP but the basic system is there. The most important things
    missing:
 * The UART (so you can play with terminal in local mode only ATM)
 * The support for alternate character sets (math symbols, big characters & line drawing)
 * Hopefully I should have some time over the holidays to work on the driver.
 * If you want to run the built-in self test, map the "TEST" key to something (I'm using F9) and press it.
 * I'm going to send the ROM set to the usual "code" e-mail.
 * Thanks.
 * -F.Ulivi

-Rewind implementation fixes and improvements [vadosnaprimer]
 * Reset scheduler savestate to what it was for years before rewind. Changing saved variables should be done after thorough testing.
    Right now, adding some vars breaks some machines, adding other vars breaks others.
 * Switch to megabyte-wise capacity. Savestate size greatly differs between machines, relying on state count is unstable.
 * Switch to internal indexing. No longer depends on inaccurate machine time.
 * Rewind accelerator key in debugger (Ctrl+F11).
 * Report capacity hit (once), with some useful info.
 * Make error reports saner. On any error, basic complaint is posted to emulator window and debugger, details go to error.log. Since
    timers are no longer dumped on every state operation, error.log is no longer getting spammed.
 * Mention rewind and rewind_capacity in the docs.
 * I'm really hoping to get this merged before feature freeze, because it fixes the rewind bugs that make it unstable. I'll be
    around until then, please report if any fixes are still needed. Probably it could also be set to On by default (docs would need
    to be tweaked too).

-pc_vga.cpp: CRTC start address is supposed to be shifted left by 2, from 86Box [Melissa Goad] Fixes #2954 [MoochMcGee]

-fmtowns: fix gaps in flipped sprites When I implemented half-size sprites I made a slight miscalculation that causes them to be
 misaligned if the flip bits are also set, creating "gaps" in, e.g. the initial view of the plane in After Burner. This fixes it by
 keeping the end coordinates fixed and modifying the start ones if the sprite is downscaled + flipped. [rzero9]

-alphatpx: identified more keys [helwie44], added P30 ROMs and labels [rfka01]

-fmtowns: fix kana input and identify missing keys This change adds support for the flags that identify the keyboard layout being
 used. For the time being I have hardcoded it as a JIS keyboard, since it's the more well-known layout and used also in other
 popular computers like the PC-9801. [rzero9]
 * The "right" way to do this would be to let the user select the keyboard layout in some way, but I am still too unfamiliar with
    the MAME internals to implement it.
 * With this change, hiragana mode now produces the expected characters (previously they wouldn't match either of the keyboard
    layouts, and some keys didn't work) and it's possible to input Japanese text normally.
 * Additionally, I have identified and labeled all keys on the JIS keyboard layout with all the possible combinations, as they
    appear on an actual keyboard.

-myb3k: WIP adding ISA bus, cards, devices and branded clones This is work in progress based on Ericsson step/one Service Manuals, a

-alphatpx: Add sound, add Alphatronic P2U and move its ROMs there, split concatenated ROMs in preparation for proper ROM naming and
 fix ROM copypaste errors, update comments. [rfka01]

-fmtowns: implement sprite rotation This change implements sprite attribute bit 14. This swaps the X and Y coordinates and allows
 for sprite rotation in 90 degree increments, by combining it with the mirroring bits. [rzero9]
 * Fixes most (but not all) graphical glitches in After Burner 1 and 3.
 * As with the half-size attributes, rotation of 16-bit color sprites is untested as I haven't found any test cases yet.

-Command to print all debugger help to html file Chapter links are sorted. [vadosnaprimer]
 * The current code generated this file: https://vadosnaprimer.github.io/debughelp.html
 * Also tweaked static_help_list spacing to always pad commands and never pad explanations. Not sure about the macro though.
 * rst file could be generated in a similar way, might try that later.

-fmtowns: implement half-size mode for sprites This change implements attribute bits 10-11 for sprites, which enable half-size
 rendering. The exact algorithm is unknown (AFAIK), so I'm just rendering alternate pixels / lines. [rzero9]
 * Documentation on the sprite attribute bits comes from the "FM Towns Technical Databook" by Noriaki Chiba.
 * It fixes some graphical artifacts in arcade ports that simulate sprite scaling like After Burner, Galaxy Force 2, Turbo Outrun
    and such. Also fixes the menu text in Azure, and possibly other things.
 * Note that half-size 16-bit color sprites are untested, as I don't know of any test cases.

-alphatp3: Two distinct ROM sets. With the 8041 keyboard controller reliably dumped, the two ROM sets represent two real machines
 that can be switched via the BIOS settings now. [rfka01]

-Trigger a fatal error when console was asked but the console plugin not found. In absence of the console plugin, the option entry
 was not found in m_plugins, making the set_value() crash when deferencing the result of get_entry(). [Mokona]
 * Instead, an error message is logged telling the plugin is not found.

-agat7: 840KB floppy HLE; minor fixes -> mark WORKING [shattered]

-fmtowns: fixed mouse cursor moving on its own in Data West games This change fixes a bug that caused the mouse cursor to move
 downwards on its own in some Data West games (Misty, Psychic Detective series, The 4th Unit series). These games seem to poll the
 mouse port in a peculiar way that caused the reads to return 0x0f sometimes even if the user wasn't moving the mouse. [rzero9]
 * It doesn't break anything in other games or in TownsOS / Windows, as far as I have tested.

-aristmk5 layout updates [Heihachi_73]

-explain the rewind command in debughlp also fix a typo in the stateload description [vadosnaprimer]

-Rewind feature and RAM savestates. This starts the work requested in #2398. Rewind is also on @mmicko's roadmap. [vadosnaprimer]
 * ### How RAM states work.
 * Implemented using `util::vectorstream`. Instead of dumping `m_save.m_entry_list` to file, it writes them as binary to
    `vectorstream`. Compression is not used, as it would slow down the process. The header is written as usual, also in binary. When
    a state is loaded, the savestate data gets binary-read from `vectorstream`.
 * ### How rewind works.
 * Rewind is optional, it can be turned off through MAME GUI while not running. Rewind capacity is available there too. Rewind step
    hotkey is available from the standard hotkey menu. In the debugger you have the `rewind` command (`rw` shortcut) that works the
    same as the hotkey.
 * Every time you advance a frame (pause step), rewinder captures a RAM savestate of the frame you were at. It does the same when
    you do step into/over/out in the debugger. Every time it captures a new state (and when you unpause), it marks as invalid all
    its states that go after the current machine time, because input might change, so they are not relevant anymore. It keeps their
    buffers allocated though, for future use. When rewinder runs out of allowed amount of savestates it can have, it invalidates the
    first state in the list and tosses its `unique_ptr` to the end of the list, then it uses its buffer to capture a new state. When
    you hit the rewind step key, or use `rewind` command in the debugger, it loads a state that is immediately before the current
    machine time. Invalid states between valid ones are not allowed to appear, as that breaks rewinder integrity and causes
    problems. Rewinder keeps its own set of ram states as a vector of `unique_ptr`'s. All rewinder operations and errors get
    reported using `machine().popmessage()`.
 * ### icount
 * Since rewinder fully depends on accurate machine time, using it during debugging uncovered a bug in savestates that causes
    non-determinism. I fixed that with a one-liner, savestates created in the past are not going to work anymore.

-fmtowns: fixed 16-bit color scrolling a bit more After further testing, it seems Vain Dream uses the horizontal adjust registers in
 16-bit color mode for a small part of the intro, and PR #2881 made it slightly worse. This should make both it and psydet5 display
 correctly. [rzero9]

-HLE of HP9845 internal printer Hi, [fulivi]
 * this PR adds the high-level emulation of hp9845-series internal printer. It also fixes a couple of things broken by the recent
    emumem API change. The printer emulation outputs the graphic image through ASCII lines, with '*' representing black pixels. I'm
    attaching a simple python script to convert this output to a bitmapped image (a PNG file, for example). I'm also sending the
    image of the character generator ROM to the "code" email address. Thank you.
 * -F.Ulivi
 * ``` #!/usr/bin/env python3
 * import sys import re import argparse from PIL import Image
 * def ensure_space(img , min_lines): s_x , s_y = img.size if s_y < min_lines:

-fmtowns: correct scrolling in 16-bit color mode Final fix for scrolling / positioning issues (hopefully). Fixes Psychic Detective
 Vol. 5. [rzero9]

-fmtowns: even better horizontal scrolling This is an improvement on PR #2873 that takes into account the scaling factor of the
 graphics layers. It improves scrolling on titles like 38man (intro), azure (title screen), and probably more. [rzero9]
 * Hi-color mode is just a guess, though. I'm not sure if there is any software that actually uses the scroll registers in this mode
    so it may not be completely right.

-Update strings.po translated 45 strings 👍 [theheroGAC]

-fmtowns: better horizontal scrolling This fixes the jerky horizontal movement in games that make use of CRTC registers 18 and 22 to
 scroll the graphics layers, including but probably not limited to: [rzero9]
 * Vain Dream Vain Dream II Hiouden II Yami no Ketsuzoku Special Eye of the Beholder II Schwarzschild IV
 * I doesn't seem to break anything else, as far as I have tested.

-fixing/improving metadata on CoCo FDCs: CP-450 and CD-6809 Thanks to Daniel Campos & Datassette.org for the CP-450 disk rom. MAME
 was calling it CP400_FDC, but the correct name of the disk controller unit is "Prológica CP-450". The ROM was correct (verified
 checksum), but I renamed it to fix the previous naming mistake. Unfortunately this FDC unit is rare, so I still don't know whats
 the IC reference for the EPROM on the PCB. [felipesanches]
 * There is a photo of the CP-450 disk controller unit at: https://datassette.org/softwares/tandy-trs-color/cp-450-basic-disco-v-10
    http://files.datassette.org/softwares/img/wp_20141212_22_08_26_pro.jpg

-Update for Brazilian Portuguese Minor fixes and typos. Added @felipesanches requests Shorted some strings as @felipesanches
 requests, not all "IU" was changed because it breaks the interface or is too long. We will have to deal with the "parent" and
 "clone" thing later, maybe the use of RAMIFICAÇÃO (RAMIFICATION OF) that will better reflect with our Language. [katananja]

-Update MAME French translation Update MAME French translation patch-2 [SSTSylvain]

-Update MAME French translation Update MAME French translation [SSTSylvain]

-weststory: verified sprite data by converting original mask rom into bootleg format and figuring out what was scrambled from there,
 it's a very simple but quite stupid bitswap on 2 of the roms.  made a note that one byte actually differs in the bootleg even after
 this, since it's been verified on 2 bootlegs it could be the original mask rom has a bad byte in it instead, should really be
 checked. [DavidHaywood]

-Prodigy webinterface poc This is just a 1-to-1 mapping of the subset of features used by the Prodigy layout so far. The XSL
 stylesheet transforms the LAY XML to SVG and also inserts necessary javascript code to set up a web socket connection to the
 Prodigy driver. Only the key pad and the BCD display works atm The internal UI is in sync with the web UI at all times.
 [JoakimLarsson]
 * The code is quite driver independent and could be moved and refactored to go into the webserver core parts to provide SVG support
    to any layout based driver, if that is the route we wanna take. I don't suggest this as a replacement of the internat UI but
    instead a complement to add SVG style driver UI:s when needed. Additional SVG elements needs to be added to the LAY file
    vocabulary that will be ignored by the internal UI. It would also be possible to convert the LAY file  once to SVG and go from
    there.
 * Another idea is to write an XSL stylesheet transforming to WebGL meshes given that dimensions can be described in the LAY file.
 * Lastly, there is nothing that prevents this UI to be served over Internet, very little needs to be changed for that except for
    A/V encoders for screens and audio that needs to be added.

-Update Dutch translations Good afternoon from The Netherlands! [mourix]
 * Added all the new strings, fixed some grammar and spelling mistakes. Should be all complete again.

-Update for Brazilian Portuguese [katananja]
 * All translation updated to follow GNOME Translation Rules for Brazilian Portuguese, this are the same rules followed by other
    Linux Distributions, Manuals, etc. Now we can avoid translation conflicts. http://br.gnome.org/GNOMEBR/ErrosFrequentes
    http://br.gnome.org/GNOMEBR/GuiaDoTradutor
 * Brazilian Portuguese REQUIRE context, it doesn't matter what a word say, we need to see what the program is doing instead of what
    the word/phrase is saying to construct the phrase correctly.
 * That ROM AUDITION functions means nothing in Brazilian Portuguese, so the translation was adapted to "Condição", this reflects
    better if the ROM is GOOD/BAD, etc.
 * OK has different meanings in Brazilian Portuguese, if you ask someone if the food was good and you reply "OK", it means that the
    food  are between good and bad or more or less. Since "Ok" doesn't reflect if the ROM is good or not, the translation was
    changed to "BOA" witch means "GOOD" following Brazilian Portuguese concordance rules "Estado dA ROM" this "A" tell us to use
    "boA" (female) instead of "BOM"(male).
 * Some parts of the translation was also adapted to fit the screen or the space the phrase is at.
 * To our language, the correct translation to plugin is plug-in.
 * A few more mistakes were fixed like Enter (to type in) = Digite not "Entre" (to get inside of) or Search = Pesquisa not "Busca",
    etc.
