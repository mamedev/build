11743: Fix synchronization for MC6847 video display generator on Dragon (PAL) machines [dave-br]
@tlindner: FYI
Fixes: https://github.com/mamedev/mame/issues/11658
PROBLEMS:
1) My prior commit (https://github.com/mamedev/mame/commit/a9519ebcd8cbf9cd48454828cac96c3d5b735376) neglected PAL machines, and
  worsened the aspect ratio for Dragons
2) Dragon timings have always been incorrect, leading to nasty shimmering while running some delicate tests
3) My last fix improved coco_cart:drgnfire, but still left an extra purple outline at the bottom of the moat (NTSC CoCo).
DETAILED FIXES:
1) 6847 implementation now supports differences between NSTC and PAL machines.  Adds PAL-padding scanlines at the correct locations
  within the field and informs screen device of the correct dimensions when those scanlines are present.
2) Improve cycle timings of HS & FS interrupts (both PAL and NTSC).  Differentiate between PAL & NTSC on when FS is issued.
3) Eliminate redundant frame timer, which was muddying the code.  Frame now changes by virtue of the last scanline getting rendered.
  Scanline timings are accurate now, so that such as a thing is reasonable to do.
4) There are 312, not 313, scanlines for PAL machines
5) Dragons need to use a consistent crystal for all components.  Dragon 6847 now bases its clock on the same 14.218_MHz_XTAL as used
  by SAM & CPU
6) coco_cart:drgnfire: no more purple outline at the bottom of the moat on NTSC CoCo.

11756: heathkit/tlb.cpp: Fix screensaver for superset slot device [mgarlanger]
To enable screensaver, the superset ROM sets the horizontal characters displayed (R1 of the 6845) to 0. 
The existing 6845 code would subtract 1 from this, causing the max_visible_x to be set to 0xffff. This value was considered invalid,
  and no further calls to update the screen were made. This caused the current text on the screen to be frozen during the
  screensaver, instead of cleared. If there is better way to handle this let me know. I had thought about on a valid -> invalid
  transition of the 6845 params, screen could be called to clear itself, but the PR change seemed more true to what the real device
  is probably doing.

clean up after hack from #10920
mame combines palette base and pen color with addition, but the high planes in gfx overlap with lowest palette line bits in the
  color address (i.e. bitwise OR). account for this discrepancy in `get_tile_info`

11790: konami/ksys573: Add Dance Dance Revolution (GC845 VER. JAB) [987123879113]
ROM dump thanks to tweak! and Caldenza. Track 23 of 845jab02 had 2 places where the audio dropped so Taro made a dump of his own CD
  to replace the old dump.
Additionally, CDDA audio volume should work properly again now. DDR will read in the CD audio control page, modify what it needs,
  then send it back on boot. In a refactor back in Sept the code was rewritten to use ptr instead of fixed offsets in the data
  buffer so all pages could be sent back when requested, but it unintentionally changed the layout of the page data so the volumes
  in older DDR games sounded really unbalanced when it tried to set the output gain for the CDDA channels to non-sense values.

11803: video/mc6845.cpp: Fix hang in ma7551t related to mc6845 [mgarlanger]
Changes in https://github.com/mamedev/mame/pull/11756 caused the ma7551t to hard lock up. With the updated code, the system seems to
  be overloaded with `handle_line_timer()` calls and initialization does not complete, even though the bool `m_has_valid_parameters`
  is false. This change, does not enable the line timer until `m_has_valid_parameters` becomes true, this allows the system to
  properly initialize. And for systems that has valid parameters, the enabling is done in `recompute_parameters()`.

11804: heathkit/tlb.cpp: Avoid clearing cliprect in MC6845_BEGIN_UPDATE for superset ROM.  [mgarlanger]
When DE is not set, use the bitmap's `rowpixels()` instead of `count_x * 8` to clear the row. This allows the removal of the
  cliprect clearing occurring in the MC6845_BEGIN_UPDATE callback, which was need to properly handle the screen saver feature of the
  superset.

11805: mame/bfm: Implement Bell Fruit 96x8 dot matrix display for Scorpion 5. [blueonesarefaster]
This implements the Bell Fruit GU96X8M-K629C3 96 * 8 VFD with led backlight.
ATM I've simply replaced the use of the BDA display which had 16 5*7 dot matrix digits with this new display driver.
If the Scorpion 5 driver is ever progressed the correct display will have to be loaded for each game.

11812: cpu/z80/z80.cpp: More accurate emulation of WZ in I/O block instructions [redcode]
### Credits
* Z80 CPU: Undocumented behavior of WZ - Manuel Sainz de Baranda y Goñi (redcode)
### Description
This tiny PR adds emulation of a recently discovered undocumented behavior of the `inir/indr/otir/otdr` instructions:
As in `cpir/cpdr/ldir/lddr`, when the repeat condition is met, the Z80 CPU generates an extra M-cycle of 5 T-states to decrement PC.
  This M-cycle performs additional flag changes (discovered and cracked by David Banks), but until now it was not known that the WZ
  register is also modified, being set, as in all other block instructions during this M-cycle, to PCi + 1 (PCi = value of PC at the
  start of the instruction, before it is incremented).
### Testing
As can be checked in the links provided below, this behavior has been verified on real hardware and in electronic simulations. It
  has been tested on 1 Zilog NMOS and 2 NEC NMOS processors. Also, the most important and so far only test suite capable of
  partially detecting this behavior has been updated accordingly.

11823: upd7220: Sync command should enable/disable the DE bit [brijohn]
The SYNC command according to the upd7220 datasheet has a DE (Display Enable) on bit one of the command byte. This should be
  processed when receiving the command.
This fixes LOGO professor on the Epson QX-10. That program during boot uses BCTRL to disable the display and then slightly later
  issues a SYNC command to re-enable the display. Without this fix the disable is never turned back on.

11826: add Casio WG-130 waveblaster device [devinacker]
Same ROM and everything else as the existing gz70sp driver, minus the test and demo inputs.

11827: Add Zstandard support for zip archives and CHDs [cuavas]
This does three things:
* Adds the Zstandard library in 3rdparty with an option to use the system-wide installation (dual BSD and GPL license).
* Adds support for zip archives members compressed with Zstandard (method 93).
* Adds support for Zstandard-compressed hunks in CHDs (`zstd` and `cdzs` codecs).
We occasionally get requests for Zstandard compression support (e.g. issue #7402).  It gives far better decompression performance
  than zlib or particularly LZMA while delivering better compression ratios than zlib.  This is important to people using emulators
  on low-end devices.  CHD decompression speed affects performance of emulated software that streams from hard disk or CD, and zip
  decompression performance affects initial load time for emulated systems.
By default, chdman will not use Zstandard compression.  This ensures that new CHDs will be backwards compatible if the user does not
  intentionally enable Zstandard compression.
You can create zip archives using Zstandard compression with WinZip, a fork of p7zip, and various other tools.

11828: trs/mc10.cpp, agvision.cpp:  remove set_raw [tlindner]
Remove set_raw from mc10 and agvision driver. No longer needed after VDG update.

11829: handheld/hh_sm510.cpp: Added Nauchpribor Altair [algestam]
This PR adds a driver for a game/radiation dosimeter "Altair".
The unit is similar to the Elektronika `gnw_mmouse` clones but has a different ROM and inputs for reading dosimeter values. More
  info can be found here:
* https://rhbz.pw/thumbnails.php?album=223
* http://rr20.ddns.net/Item.aspx?ItemId=47363047-2f0c-4b76-8d68-202ae0634d7b&Lang=En
The dosimeter mode can be entered when the game is in time mode. Dosimeter mode is started when pressing the right up button. The
  port name has been changed in the MAME driver to reflect this.
Adding this as a draft as there are some things that needs to be worked out before this gets merged:
* The Altair unit is currently configured as a clone (child) of `gnw_mmouse`. Is this ok or should it be defined as separate driver
  perhaps?
* The "protocol" between the dosimeter reader and the game PCB are four inputs that allows incrementing the dosimeter reading with
  +1, +2, +4 and +8 when the input is set high for respective input. When the input is lowered, the remaining value up to 16 is
  incremented (i.e. if +2 was added when high, +14 gets added when lowered).
  The four dosimeter inputs are defined as separate configuration options. Could this be represented in a better way in MAME
  perhaps?

11843: Add new machine Tandberg TDV-2115L with accurate addressing in Display Logic driver [Frodevan]
The Tandberg TDV-2115L is a terminal based on the Tandberg Display Logic module, and is the most basic member of the TDV-2100 series
  of terminals and computer products from Tandberg.
Background: I recently dumped the addressing PROMs on the Tandberg TDV-2100 series Display Logic module, and the aim of this PR is
  to use this to add proper emulation of the vram addressing. As a result, a feature which was previously simulated (page roll), is
  now emulated the same way it is operating in hardware.
In addition to this, due to the more robust vram addressing, the conditional checks for the cursor have been changed to work like
  the real hardware.
Summary:
* Add vram address-encode PROM
* Properly emulate a roll-counter used for page up/down
* Increase accuracy of cursor positioning
The two additional ROMs can be found here:

  NVRAM was extracted from the NVRAM data (bytes 0x2a-0x30, reversed) and the serial checksum generated to make a new
  ds2430_code1d2.u3 that works with the paired NVRAM so no more RTC self-check errors.
code1da was removed because it's just another copy of 922d02. If you extract the two CHDs and mount them as FAT16 then you can find
  the main ROM file on the filesystem. If you do a checksum comparison of those two files you can see they're identical. The
  differences in the CHDs seem to come from metadata or other filesystem-related things.

11846: cidelsa.cpp: Add Cidelsa's "Altair II" [clawgrip]
New working machine
-------------------------
Altair II [Basilio García, Recreativas.org]
Also renamed the difficulty levels on all driver's games from "Conservative" / "Liberal" to standard names. Cidelsa uses standard
  names, Spanish (fácil / difícil) or English (easy / difficult), on their documents, I have not found a single reference of
  "Conservative"/ "Liberal".

11847: heathkit/h89.cpp: Implement single-step hardware [mgarlanger]

11857: Nimbus joystick fix [RobinSergeant]
This pull request fixes RM Nimbus joystick emulation by using the correct port address for directional data and setting the correct
  bits when that address is read.  Currently the mouse data port (0xa4) is used for all joystick data, but only the buttons are
  actually read from this port.  The joystick port (0xa0) is used for the directional data as described in chapter 2 of of the
  service manual (https://www.thenimbus.co.uk/upgrades-and-maintenance/service-manual).
This can be demonstrated/tested by running the following RM Basic program which does not work without my change:
```
10 SET MODE 40
20 SET JOYSTICK
30 REPEAT
40   ASK JOYSTICK X%, Y%, Button%
50   POINTS X%, Y%
60 UNTIL Button% = 1
```
I have also removed the "Input Port 0 Device" config port as this is no longer necessary and prevented the mouse buttons from
  working properly when set to the wrong value (the original code read joystick data when this was to "mouse", and mouse data when
  it was set to "joystick").  The mouse and joystick can now co-exist quite happily with joystick buttons doubling as mouse buttons
  and vice versa.
The wrong bits were also being set for each direction and I have of course corrected these to match those given in the service
  manual.  The above RM Basic program proves that theses are now correct.
The original machine also allowed switching between two joysticks by writing to ports 0xa0 (to select joystick 0) and 0xa2 (to
  select joystick 1), but I have not implemented this as it seems unnecessary - I have not found any software that makes use of it
  and I don't think it's possible to test using RM Basic.
Please let me know if you have any questions!

11867: add support for 2nd RM Nimbus joystick [RobinSergeant]
This PR adds support for a second joystick on the RM Nimbus.  I decided to do this after discovering the RM Basic demo program that
  covers joystick support.  It's basically a two player paint program with two brushes (each controlled by a different joystick).
  To run the demo start RM Basic and type
```
load "mousedem"
run
```
(then wait until it asks about having a joystick before pressing a key to begin).
Interestingly this demo makes it obvious that each joystick should actually only have one button!  This fits with the description of
  using an Atari style joystick, given in the service manual, as those joysticks only had one button.  Hence the button data
  returned via the mouse data port actually relates to the button status of both joysticks.
Questions and comments welcome.

11868: Improve interrupt handing in mb88xx [hackbar]
This deals with the interrupt handler a little better, and fixes Arabian bugs caused by mb88xx bugs.
I tested it with the other games that use that chip, and didn't see any regressions. Most importantly, none in bosco sound. The 54xx
  in bosco seem especially sensitive to interrupt races, causing the pitch of shots to be wrong.
Should fix https://mametesters.org/view.php?id=8436 & https://mametesters.org/view.php?id=3916

11869: neogeo/neogeo_v.cpp: Make palette byte access behave the same as on real hardware [zardam]

11883: igs/pgm.cpp: redump martmasttw [mistydemeo]
I saw the comment that u9/u10 in martmasttw are possibly a bad dump, so I dumped them from my own cartridge. They came back as
  identical to martmast102c, so looks like it was a bad dump previously. The ARM ROM looks like it's the only unique ROM in this
  set. That dump is still bad; I'm not sure how to dump it, though if someone has the custom ROM/ROMs that are used to do that I'm
  happy to give it a go.

11884: netronics/exp85.cpp: implemented rom mirroring, fixed interrupt handling timing [fmilano]
The Netronics Explorer-85 has dedicated circuitry for mirroring the monitor ROM to  low memory (0x0000 -- 0x0800) after a system
  start/reset and during an interrupt. This logic was reproduced as accurately as possible, since the emulation of the intel 8085
  does not have the pin outs needed for implementing the exact logic used in the original circuitry (IO/M, S0, S1 and ALE).
With the mirror switching working, it is possible to execute the MS BASIC ROM (it uses the low memory 8KB of RAM).
 <img src="https://github.com/mamedev/mame/assets/1981459/d230e832-81a4-46e1-ab5a-fb432c4e39d1" alt="Microsoft Basic" width="500"/>
Another non-working feature was the step by step execution capability of the monitor program. This tracer uses a timer to interrupt
  the executing program once per instruction. In a real system the 8155 timer chip has a delay of around ~70ns (measured). This is
  enough for the next instruction cycle to start and for the interrupt to be acknowledged one instruction later. This effect is
  fundamental for the ROM monitor stepping functionality. This is solved with a MAME timer, dealying the 8155 to signal. The
  stepping mechanism is now working:

11889: Make building emulator optional [mmicko]
Made this by popular demand of building tools and not MAME executable. 
By using `make TOOLS=1 EMULATOR=0` it is now possible to build tools only. 

11890: rm/rmnimbus.cpp: Allow choice of HLE mouse processing [RobinSergeant]
The current implementation tries to simulate the mouse interrupts generated by the real hardware, but this results in very erratic
  movement and a poor user experience (see https://mametesters.org/view.php?id=5745).
After studying this for some time I've come to the conclusion that we don't really need to generate the interrupts at all because
  all software seems to use the default mouse ISR from the BIOS.  This PR basically bypasses the ISR and updates the mouse position
  directly by writing to the memory locations used by the BIOS.  I found these by stepping through the ISR with the debugger.
I've tested this with all 6 BIOS versions and a variety of software, e.g.
RM Basic
Menu
Canvas
Windows 3.0
PaintSPA
Microsoft Word 3.1
It seems to work fine and the mouse finally behaves normally :-)
Do you think this is the correct solution?  Obviously it would be better to have the interrupts working properly, but from a user
  perspective I think having normal mouse behaviour is more important.  Very little software was written for the Nimbus and it seems
  unlikely that there is anything out there that does not use the BIOS routines - unless somebody knows otherwise?  Also has anyone
  come across software that reads the mouse by polling?  I've tried to support that method (as before), but cannot find any programs
  that don't enable the mouse interrupts.
Any comments on the solution itself would also be welcome, e.g. is there a better way to write to the memory or some thread
  synchronisation method that I'm not aware of.
Config port now included to allow the mouse emulation mode to be chosen by the user (defaults to "Real", with "HLE" for the new high
  level emulation).

Adds the H-88-5 cassette interface board and the H88 clone of the H89. 
Adding the H88 clone (which Heath Company sold with only the cassette interface board) is simpler and more historically accurate. 
MTR-88 BIOS was also change to only be valid with the H88 and the only bios supported by the H88. 

11899: jvc_dsk, os9_dsk.cpp: Add 3.5 inch disk formats, adjust scoring [tlindner]
The CoCo driver includes a 3.5 inch disk drive option, but the specific formats were missing from the os9 format list.

 - dma read has priority if both read and write are enabled.
 - the side select bit in the status reg is connected to the twosided signal from the drive, and not from the sso signal from the
  fdc.

For symmetry with `-skip`, it is convenient to specify `-count` using the same number base, e.g. `-skip 0x1000 -count 0x200`.
  Unprefixed count values are still interpreted as decimal, as before.

------------------------
(GC0009 and SP-01 are playable with Popira / Popira 2, SP-01 is also playable with Taiko de Popira, all run with eKara but with no
  microphone input)
The Hi-Kara emulation can play the cartridges, but there's no microphone input.
------------------------
this also confirms sc-8 as a good dump, it has been dumped from a 2nd cartridge with idential results, and the same 'crash on score
  screen' issue on real hardware.  It is unknown if a fixed version exists (it seems like a serious bug, and they did do a cart
  revision of another cart just to remove the WTC image so it would be strange if there isn't a fixed version)
------------------------
Also removed an old workaround for excite fishing that is no longer needed with the improved SEEPROM emulation from last year.

This change enables debugging of several older 8-bit platforms with the llvm-mos toolchain.  For example, with this change, you can
  do limited source-level debugging with the llvm-mos build of lldb.
Thanks in advance for accepting this change request.

11954: misc/sttechno: Implement xflip and yflip flags [987123879113]
Implemented xflip and yflip flags that I had previously noted but didn't know where to test in-game. The big mouse no longer
  moonwalks on the first stage.
Small cleanup: I noticed I had swapped `tile_x` and `tile_y` when renaming them from old temp variable names during cleanup so I
  fixed that too.
