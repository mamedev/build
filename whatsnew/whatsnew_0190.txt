Source Changes
--------------
-Correct regions for  Cyber Cycles， Dirt Dash, Time Crisis, Tokyo Wars and Armadillo Racing sets [sjy96525]

-vamphalf.cpp: Add speedup to Cool Mini set. [Brian Troha]

-floppy: Add drive LED callback [Dirk Best]
 * This currently only works if you set the drive select lines correctly, which the upd765 does now. Hook it up to the psi98 driver
    and use the TEAC FD-55F drive instead of the generic one.
 * This is some basic first work to better model the real hardware and floppy drive setups in the future.

 * arm7: Various changes: [Ryan Holtz]
   - Added ARM946ES variant.
   - Fixed up CPU ID values.

 * nds: Skeleton driver. [Ryan Holtz]

-Royal Jackpot: Added proper inputs & DIP switches, changed game description and promoted to working. [Roberto Fresca]

 bit is ignored if rp is the destination register of the current opcode. [Jonas Quinn]

-z8: Mask addresses for external memory accesses based on P0 control bits [AJR]

-HP HIL: passthrough commands between devices [Sven Schnelle]
 * The old code didn't loopback commands that are sent to a non-existing HIL address. Unfortunately the HP 9000/300 Boot ROM does
    that: it send a IDD command to every possible address and fails if it's not looped back.
 * This also changes the API. HIL devices are now able to return true if the command should be passed on to the next devices, or
    false it it shouldn't. This is required for initial configuration of the Bus and various other commands like POLL, which are
    sent to the global address.
 * Signed-off-by: Sven Schnelle <svens@stackframe.org>

-HP9000/300: Add HIL keyboard support [Sven Schnelle]
 * Signed-off-by: Sven Schnelle <svens@stackframe.org>

-HP9000/300: fix detection of DIO cards [Sven Schnelle]
 * Install a buserror handler for the DIO/DIO-II card ranges. The 300 BOOT ROM expects to get a Buserror signal to detect if there's
    a card. Also remove that memory of PC's doing invalid Bus accesses as this breaks this detection.
 * Signed-off-by: Sven Schnelle <svens@stackframe.org>

-HP9000/300: disable DMA controller workaround [Sven Schnelle]
 * Faking the DMA register set with RAM makes the 'Failed' message go away, but makes the ROM use DMA functionality even if there's
    none. Seen this while working on HPIB support which tries to transfer data via DMA and fails. When disabling the DMA hack the
    ROM falls back to PIO mode.
 * Signed-off-by: Sven Schnelle <svens@stackframe.org>

-luaengine: translation support [Carl]

-z8: Fix C flag polarity for CP, SBC, SUB and actually subtract with carry in SBC [AJR]

 * have now tested 82586 version successfully
 * include heartbeat indicator on all transmits to pass InterPro diagnostic
 * also corrected a bug affecting long frames - now allows up to 64k, slightly worried about the increase in save state, but don't
    have a better idea

-natural keyboard: prefer lower shift states, eliminate O(n) lookup [Vas Crabb]
 * allows Alt-combos on European Amiga keyboards to be restored as MAME will now prefer the simpler Shift-combos to get characters
    that can be typed in more than one way

-clipper: interrupt handling fixes [Patrick Mackinlay]
 * improve interrupt vector handling
 * fix C300 interrupt entry and stack frame
 * fix pushw where source register is same as stack register

 * hp9k_3xx: hook up keyboard/sound to HP9000/332

-hp9k_3xx: add 98603 ROM card [Sven Schnelle]
 * Even if BASIC doesn't boot yet it's handy to have the ROM card in the code and BASIC in the software list.

-promoted protected Maniac Square sets to working [Peter Wilhelmsen, Morten Shearman Kirkegaard, Charles MacDonald, David Haywood]

-new Apple II softlist addition [briantro]
 * apple2.xml: Theif [san inc. & TRex]

-superqix.cpp: Correctly implemented 8751 port2 latch based on pcb tracing. Fixed semaphores implementation to match pcb tracing.
 Got rid of z80<->mcu 'pending' communication hacks by using synchronize calls. Moved superqix specific variables and member
 functions to its own subclass. Consolidated the 8031 bootleg and 8751 protected set port2 handling code. Removed some unnecessary
 trampoline functions. [Lord Nightmare]

-superqix: added a sync trampoline for reading the semaphores via the ay-3-8910 #1, MCFG_QUANTUM_PERFECT is no longer needed.

-itech8.cpp: Ninja Clowns improvements [Angelo Salese]
 * Fixed palette read accesses, fixes many color bugs (title screen fade-in, water spray properly blue, color cycle effects in bonus
    stage);
 * Fixed 0x40000-0x7ffff constant area, now program ROM checksum correctly returns OK status;

-itech8.cpp: moved vblank irq generation for Ninja Clowns, fixes frames per second jerkiness [Angelo Salese]

-demote Panic Road (panicr) to MACHINE_NOT_WORKING playtesting shows that the collisions aren't right, broken collisions = broken
 game logic = MACHINE_NOT_WORKING flag, we have higher standards. [David Haywood]

-COP400 overhaul [AJR]
 * Rewrite the execution control logic to fetch each byte of an instruction separately in one pass of the main loop. This provides
    EEPROM-compatible timing for the SIO shift register, allowing the 93C46 on quizpun2 to be read and written properly (though its
    default contents are a bad dump).
 * Add M pseudo-register (internal RAM referenced by B) to debugger state.
 * Add T register to debugger state on devices where it only affects SKT.
 * The SIO state is now displayed in binary when it is defined as a shift register.
 * Skipped instructions and the SKIP flag can be debugged by compile-time switch (disabled by default).

-dccons.cpp: virginize DC flash ROM dumps to fresh factory state [MetalliC]

-fix corrupt bytes in two mc68705 dumps after re-analysis of raw dump data.  [Lord Nightmare, ShouTime]

-apple2e: don't update 80-col screen immediately on page switch [Peter Ferrie]

-upd765: sense interrupt status and i82072 changes (#2632) [Patrick Mackinlay]
 * Yet another attempt at implementing the i82072 sense interrupt status logic. This time, I've separated the logic into the derived
    class, so it won't affect the other devices. Also included motor on/off logic (unique to i82072) - motor on delay is incomplete.

-iteagle: Set medium resolution as default for virtpool and remove MACHINE_IMPERFECT_GRAPHICS. [Ted Green]

-New device: Data East IRQ Controller [Dirk Best]
 * Used by games in the cninja and deco32 drivers. This implies proper VBlank IRQ ack for all games now. Also added and improved raw

-flstory.cpp: merged memory maps, and fixed gfx bank default (fixes Onna Sanshirou POST messages) [Angelo Salese]

-Attempted to sanitize/rationalize how we access UTF-8 command line arguments (#2532) [npwoods]
 * Specifically, this creates a call osd_get_command_line() that returns UTF-8 command line arguments as std::vector<std::string>.
    On non-Windows platforms, this does nothing more than build the vector.  On Windows, this invokes GetCommandLineW() and
    CommandLineToArgvW().  This also attempts to unwind usage of wmain()/_tmain() on Windows, which is not standard.
 * Related to this, this fixes a bug in Imgtool; specifically, non-7 bit ASCII was not being handled correctly in Windows.
 * This is really an admission that the way that Windows handles Unicode and command line arguments sucks, and it is my belief that
    having a wmain() or _tmain() declaration specific for Windows is a worse solution.  C'est la vie.
 * I'm very open to the idea that src/osd/osdcore.[cpp|h] is not the best place to do this.  Let me know if I should move it.

-bigevglf.cpp: added DAC (cup in, crowd applauses samples) [Angelo Salese]

-Added comments and EuroPC II and EuroXT variants, corrected RAM size on EuroPC and slot configuration. EMS memory doesn't work on
 EuroPC II and XT (should be able to be configured from the BIOS, but options don't show up, DOS EMS driver doesn't load). [rfka01]

-Added support for viewing the pls100 device to jedutil [keshbach]

-Candela PAL driven address map tried a long time to use bank devices for this but as it used two levels of indirection, eg 2 banks
 of 16 banks each where each of the 16 banks can point to any device/ram/rom segment, it got very complex and it was never working
 and almost impossible to understand. So I rewrote it in plain code and a number of previously not working BASIC commands started
 working. There are more to do but this is a nice milestone towards booting OS9. [JoakimLarsson]
 * I also made some C11 strings legacy aware in the PTM and ACIA devices.

-sms/gamegear misc fixes [Enik Land]
 * correct author of the SMS multipad device hardware.

 * remove two obsolete comments from the period when MESS didn't supported BIOS selection.
 * change two comments to document that player inputs on GG aren't disabled even in SMS mode.

-AEG Olympia Olytext 30 added. Additional Z80 card needs to be ... ... emulated to run original word processor. The Olytext 30 is an
 XT compatible, the BIOS works well with the PC emulation. The original word processor is running on a Z80 coprocessor card that

 * fix C300 interrupt entry and stack frame
 * fix pushw where source register is same as stack register
 * switch to logmacro.h logging
 * Note: this does break the InterPro system - it compiles, but interrupts don't work. The relevant changes are tangled up with
    other InterPro system changes that I'll submit later.

-upd765: sense interrupt status and i82072 changes [pmackinlay]
 * changed sense interrupt status drive busy bit handling for seek/recalibrate (only cleared when first result byte is read)
 * changed sis to return results in decrementing drive order
 * added i82072 motor on/off command
 * switched to logmacro.h logging convention
 * Note: I haven't tested the sense interrupt status change on anything other than the InterPro systems I'm targeting. Hopefully
    someone else is set up to do so: only the change to the order of sis results is dubious - it's not covered by the documentation
    I've seen so far, but relied on by the InterPro 2000 diagnostic code.

-i82586: fixed 82586 initialisation [pmackinlay]
 * tested 82586 device successfully (with InterPro 2000)
 * include heartbeat indicator on all transmits to pass InterPro diagnostic
 * corrected a bug affecting long frames (now allows up to 64k, slightly worried about the increase in save state, but don't have a
    better idea)

-hp9k_3xx: hook up keyboard/sound to HP9000/332 [sschnelle]

-hp9k_3xx: add 98603 ROM card Even if BASIC doesn't boot yet it's handy to have the ROM card in the code and BASIC in the software
 list. [sschnelle]

-Improved 68340, 68681 and dbox support A cleaner PR than my previous. I reached my mile stone as I am able to hook up a terminal to
 the serial port. In theory it will now be possible to flash the dbox with a shareware called DVB2000 by using a PC utility that
 connects over serial, it is not tested yet as I need to figure out how to do that, either from a DOSbox or a second MAME instance.
 Please review in particular the way I created the serial module by inherit the duart driver. I think it works well but there could
 impurities in the way I did it. [JoakimLarsson]

-dbox: added 29F800B flash boot device This should be a clean merge as no dependencies from other drivers towards this new device
 exists. I am also pending on this being merged to rebase and PR the rest of my dbox/68340  work [JoakimLarsson]

 * validate will now report an error if no matches occur [npwoods]

-HP9000/300: Add SN76494 sound device [sschnelle]

-Dutch language strings fully translated Hi. These are all the translations needed for MAME 0.189. Hope this will help. [mourix]

-HP9000/300: disable DMA controller workaround Faking the DMA register set with RAM makes the 'Failed' message go away, but makes
 the ROM use DMA functionality even if there's none. Seen this while working on HPIB support which tries to transfer data via DMA
 and fails. When disabling the DMA hack the ROM falls back to PIO mode. [sschnelle]
 * Signed-off-by: Sven Schnelle <svens@stackframe.org>

-HP9000/300: fix detection of DIO cards Install a buserror handler for the DIO/DIO-II card ranges. The 300 BOOT ROM expects to get a
 Buserror signal to detect if there's a card. Also remove the memory of PC's doing invalid Bus accesses as this breaks this
 detection. [sschnelle]
 * Signed-off-by: Sven Schnelle <svens@stackframe.org>

-Hil keyboard support for HP9000/300 [sschnelle]

-luaengine: translation support [Carl] Making a pull request for comment about whether this is wanted and if so how to add to
 workflow.  Seems to work fine with find with xgettext anyhow. [cracyc]

-Added a natural keyboard validation to check for valid natural keyboard (uni)codes I had to shuffle the SHIFT_COUNT/SHIFT_STATE
 enums around, and I also moved the "char casting" hack.  Vas might have opinions on how this was done. [npwoods]

-Returning a reference from various corestr.cpp calls to avoid unnecessary string copies [npwoods]

-cgc7900: attach keyboard and serial port, force cold boot [shattered]

-Update strings.po Translated one missing string [aviloria]

-Mame 0.189 Italian Language 100% translated. Hi, I've updated the translation of the Italian language for Mame 0.189. [Tharabas17]

-upd765: added i82072 Minimal support for i82072: write access to the data rate select register is enough for InterPro 2000 support
 right now. [pmackinlay]

-add apple2_cass softlist This starts a cassette softlist for the apple2 series. Includes tapes with ml, integer basic, and
 applesoft basic. [Dagarman]
 * https://www.sendspace.com/file/53yw41

-Correct regions for  Cyber Cycles, Dirt Dash, Time Crisis, Tokyo Wars and Armadillo Racing sets [sjy96525]

-Attempted to sanitize/rationalize how we access UTF-8 command line arguments Specifically, this creates a call
 osd_get_command_line() that returns UTF-8 command line arguments as std::vector<std::string>.  On non-Windows platforms, this does
 nothing more than build the vector.  On Windows, this invokes GetCommandLineW() and CommandLineToArgvW().  This also attempts to
 unwind usage of wmain()/_tmain() on Windows, which is not standard. [npwoods]
 * Related to this, this fixes a bug in Imgtool; specifically, non-7 bit ASCII was not being handled correctly in Windows.
 * This is really an admission that the way that Windows handles Unicode and command line arguments sucks, and it is my belief that
    having a wmain() or _tmain() declaration specific for Windows is a worse solution.  C'est la vie.
 * I'm very open to the idea that src/osd/osdcore.[cpp|h] is not the best place to do this.  Let me know if I should move it.
