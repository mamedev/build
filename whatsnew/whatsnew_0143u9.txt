MAMETesters Bugs Fixed
----------------------
- 04509: [Core] Analog controls are broken on keyboard when joystick
         is enabled (Alex Jackson)
- 04394: [DIP/Input] All games with paddle inputs: IPT_PADDLE inputs
         do not center properly when mapped to an analog joystick
	 (Alex Jackson)

Source Changes
--------------
fix listing of switches used by gambling games [kanikani]

Hooked up MC6845 to Laser Base [Angelo Salese]

Hooked up PIT to Laser Base [Angelo Salese, Tomasz Slanina]

Changed some of the default mappings for analog controls in order to
fix various input-fighting bugs (including, but not limited to,
MT#4394 and MT#4509). Reverted the u8 change to analog joystick
handling--it only partially solved the problem it was meant to fix, it
introduced new issues in return, and generally made the code more
complicated for little benefit [Alex Jackson]

Improved game documentation to Naomi / Triforce / Chihiro HW [f205v]

New clones added
----------------
Battle Shark (Japan, Joystick) [ShouTime]
