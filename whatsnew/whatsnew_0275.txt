12957: Add Casio WK-1600/1800 [devinacker]
I'm opening this as a draft for now due to issues with the WK-1800 floppy drive, any help would be appreciated:
- pressing the Disk button with the drive empty starts the drive motor, then the firmware waits forever on some status bit that is
  never set
- pressing the Disk button with a disk inserted results in several 'forced abort' errors from the H8 DMA controller
- wk1800 firmware seems to rely on different TS bit behavior from the HD63266 compared to a standard uPD765, but I have not checked
  this against other machines that use the same FDC (e.g. those Brother word processors)

12984: HP98x6: added HP98628 & HP98629 expansion cards [fulivi]
Hi,
this PR adds the support for HP98628 & HP98629 expansion cards on HP98x6 systems.
A few notes:
* In theory, all existing 16-bit DIO cards should work on 98x6 machines. I had no time
  to test them, though. That's the reason why for the time being I'm keeping the two
  cards I developed on a separate set of optional cards (the one in dio16_hp98x6_cards
  function). Once the other 16-bit cards are tested on hp98x6, the two lists will
  be merged.
* I realized that the 98603a and 98603b cards that @svenschnelle developed have the same
  function of two optional ROMs I put in the ROM software list. I don't know what should
  be the preferred way to add optional ROMs, either as a plug-in card or as a ROM in
  a sw list.
* 98629 card was used to interface to a kind of LAN that HP called SRM (Shared Resource
  Management). I implemented a file server in Python for it. I will release it once this
  PR is accepted.
* I'm going to send the related ROM images shortly.
Thanks.

It seems that zooming requires more resolution but uses 9 bit otherwise.
This should fix the missing background for harddunk in attract mode, while also working with radr map selection, alien3 map between
  stages and so on. Has not been verified to real hardware but it seems to test correctly with all games. Let me know if there's a
  specific transition / case you would like tested.

13070: Cherry-pick wayland improvements from upstream bgfx [belegdol]
As full sync with upstream is not an option at the moment (see https://github.com/mamedev/mame/pull/13054#issuecomment-2531577035),
  cherry-pick recent wayland fixes from upstream bgfx instead.
This uses the API more correctly as well as moves wayland detection to runtime, reducing the build requirements slightly.

13074: superxavix: some research on the bitmap layer, slight visual improvement where it gets used + general XaviX refactoring and

- Started to refactor XaviX bus accesses, moved some in-cartridge logic for e-Kara SEEPROMs to cartridge space
- XaviX external bus accesses can now go through memory, avoiding the speed-up bypass
- Mapped RAM in external space for Super TV-PC sets, as well as a ROM bank, allowing bitmaps in RAM to render
- Added Bitmap plotter, again used by Super TV-PC sets for constructing some bitmaps and the paint program in Super TV-PC Hello
  Kitty
- Added previously unsupported video mode used by Excite Stadium
- Swapped background order when priorities are equal, issue higlighted by Excite Golf 
- Added some XaviX2000 (2nd Gen and SuperXaviX) opcodes needed by Let's! TV Play Touin Ougi Onmyou Taisenki: Mezase Saikyou
  Toushinshi for sprites to show
- Added reduced size sprite DMA transfers, used by Choro-Q Byun Byun Racer 
- Allow SuperXaviX sets to render in higher horizontal resolutions for proper display of the bitmap layers, doubling the standard
  XaviX output to match
- Began some research on SuperXaviX extended ROM modes, used by anpanmdx for sprites and the bitmap layer

13090: Advanced skeleton driver for the Memorymoog. [m1macrophage]
This driver is marked as ~a skeleton~ "not working", because it is not really usable without a layout. Nonetheless, a large portion
  of the digital logic and digital-analog interface is emulated. There is no attempt to emulate audio.
Following the Source (#12917), this is the second in a series of 8 (at the moment) synth drivers.
Similar to the previous PR, I've incorporated feedback I've seen in other people's PRs, but I am sure I missed things. Happy to fix
  as needed and proactively apply any feedback to future drivers.

13108: Fixes to UML and DRC backends [987123879113]
I've been working on a project involving the DRC lately and found several bugs and inconsistencies when trying to compare results so
  I tried to fix bugs and make things more consistent between all of the backends.
Most of the fixes are to mostly unused code paths so I'm not expecting it to fix many, if any, of the known DRC issues.
I'd appreciate it if people could test the DRC in various games or operating systems before merging so I'm only sending this as a
  draft PR for now. I've tested mostly SH-4 (Naomi) and PPC (Firebeat) games and I'm not noticing any differences.
- Added new opcodes
    - BREAK: Hardware breakpoint that can be caught in a debugger to see exactly what assembly is being generated at any given time.
  (Warning: will crash the program if used without a debugger attached so use carefully)
    - SETFLGS: Set the hardware flags to a specific state. Meant for debugging such as testing opcodes in various states
    - MULUH and MULSH: Unsigned and signed multiplication where the result is only the lower half and the status flags are
  calculated based on the lower half. Previously the MULU and MULS opcodes would change how status flags were calculated based on
  whether the upper half output destination was set to something different than the lower half output destination so I decided to
  split them off to make their intended usages and status register calculations more explicit.
- General fixes
    - Standardized how shifts are calculated between the various backends so status flags and results should be the same now
- UML fixes
    - Fixed broken multiplication and division in the simplifier
    - Fixed shift calculations in the simplifier to work the same as the backends
    - Changed GETFLGS definition such that it will not change status flags in the process of reading out the status flags (and made
  appropriate changes in backends)
- C backend
    - Some opcodes wouldn't be recognized depending on the surrounding operation flag usages so I added the cases where I
  encountered unrecognized opcodes
    - Fixed various broken flag calculations
    - Fixed output when a shift is called with a shift of 0 (previously wouldn't set the output value at all)
- x86 backend
    - Many of the 64-bit operations were outright broken so I fixed those up as much as I could
    - Fixes to status flag calculations
- x64 backend
    - Fixed some unsafe code in the FNEG implementation that'd cause segfaults if the case was actually used anywhere (it wasn't)
    - Fixes to status flag calculations
- Added some extra documentation in uml.cpp for opcodes with cryptic namings and some status flag behavior
- Removed a lot of useless comments in the format of `a.test(ecx, ecx); // test ecx,ecx`. I didn't get them all because there's too
  many so mostly just on the code I touched. The comments almost 99% of the time are exactly the same as the assembly code it's
  beside so they aren't needed.

Two are for implicit casts (which the visual studio build elevates to Errors) and one is for an unused variable.
Since these break compilation from a fresh build in default conditions, and the project is set to elevate warnings to errors, these
  likely should be fixed.

13123: MT08472: heap overflow [holub]

13124: taitotz.cpp: Standards cleanup and a functional fix [MooglyGuy]
This change does some structural cleanup to this largely-abandoned file, mainly:
- Removal of unnecessary parentheses and case-bracing
- Case indentation
- Operator spacing
- C++ versus C-style comments for single-line comments
It also removes some small chunks of `#if 0`'d code, and moves some other previously `#if 0`'d code behind `if
  (SOME_CONSTEXPR_DRIVER_MEMBER)` in order to avoid code-rot.
As something of a bonus change, there is a fix to expected packet-size calculation in `taitotz_renderer::push_direct_poly_fifo`,
  which in turn avoids a fatalerror (which has since been removed) in Raizin Ping Pong's attract mode.
The fatalerror was reportedly due to an unsupported direct-geometry vertex count of 2, but this only came about due to single-vertex
  direct geometry not consuming an appropriate number of words, resulting in `push_direct_poly_fifo` attempting to process a
  vertex's header word in place of a direct-geometry header word.

13127: CD-i: Fix DYUV Format [Vincent-Halver]
This change fixes the following issues with the DYUV format:
1. The DYUV format incorrectly was too dark by 16/256. This fix corrects a previously incorrect attempt to fix that issue.
2. The DYUV format does not allow Mosaic features.
To Validate this change:
1. Use the Validation CD (Europe).
2. Click "Philips Tests"
3. Click "Video Representations"
4. Click "DYUV Decoder"
Result:
The DYUV format is slightly brighter. Mosaic effects will work more correctly. Unfortunately I don't know of a good example of how
  to see the mosaic behavior difference, however the spec makes it clear this configuration is not allowed.
Uncertain Issues:
The previous midpoint interpolation of 129+129 would be 1. The spec agrees with that formula. As the expected behavior is not yet
  well understood, a modified algorithm is used to produce more sensible midpoints that do not have this rollover artifact.
Known Issues:
There are further transparency issues that are out of scope for this update.
RGB format fix is not included in this update. Previous discussion about color/noise can be safely ignored for now, and discussed in
  the RGB update later.
There are further format issues.

13160: minitel2: fix modem and periinfo default configurations [fabio-d]
I've tested the command line given at the top of the `minitel_2_rpic.cpp` file (`-modem null_modem -bitb socket.127.0.0.1:20000`)
  and it didn't work (transferred data was corrupted), because the correct serial parameters are set for `terminal`. This commit
  makes them apply to `null_modem` instead, so that the documented command line actually works.
While at it, I've also changed the parameters for the second serial port (`periinfo`) to match the Minitel's defaults and verified
  that it actually works, despite the comment at the top of the file stating the opposite.
These are all the test command lines I've successfully validated, to test that the two Minitel serial ports (`modem` and `periinfo`)
  work, both in isolation and together. I've used minipavi.fr as the test service to connect to.
### Test n.1: Connecting to a Minitel service through the modem port
Run in two different terminals:
* `socat tcp-listen:20000,fork system:'"set -x; IFS= read -d S; echo -n \"Connecting...\"; exec nc go.minipavi.fr 516"'`
* `./mame -window minitel2 -modem null_modem -bitb socket.127.0.0.1:20000`
Then power on the Minitel (F10) and start the connection (F8).
**Notes:**
* `IFS= read -d S`: waits for the `Connexion ou déconnexion modem` message (`"\x13S"`), emitted when the emulated Minitel modem
  pretends to start detecting the carrier frequency.
### Test n.2: Connecting to a Minitel service through the serial port
Run in two different terminals:
* `socat tcp-listen:20000,fork system:'"set -x; IFS= read -d r; IFS= read -d r; sleep 3; echo -en \"\\e\\x39\\x68\"; sleep 3; echo
  -en \"\\e\\x39\\x67\\e\\x3b\\x60\\x58\\x52Connecting...\"; exec nc go.minipavi.fr 516"'`
* `./mame -window minitel2 -periinfo null_modem -bitb socket.127.0.0.1:20000`
Then just power on the Minitel (F10), the socat command above will do the rest to put the Minitel in the right mode and start the
  connection.
**Notes:**
* `IFS= read -d r` (twice) : wait for the second `Passage en veille ou sortie de veille` message (`"\x13r"`, emitted by the Minitel
  when powered on)
* `\e\x39\x68` (called `PRO1 CONNEXION` in the manual): tells the Minitel to connect the `modem` port.
* `\e\x39\x67` (called `PRO1 DECONNEXION` in the manual):  tells the Minitel to disconnect the `modem` port.
* We don't actually use the `modem` port at all, we just send `PRO1 CONNEXION` followed by `PRO1 DECONNEXION` to make it leave the
  initial address book screen and enter the mode that displays incoming data.
* `\e\x3b\x60\x58\x52` -> `PRO3 OFF` to disable local echo
### Test n.3: Both ports at the same time
Run in three different terminals:
* `socat tcp-listen:20000,fork stdio`
* `socat tcp-listen:20001,fork stdio`
* `./mame -window minitel2 -modem null_modem -bitb1 socket.127.0.0.1:20000 -periinfo null_modem -bitb2 socket.127.0.0.1:20001`
Then power on the Minitel (F10), start the connection (F8) and notice how everything typed into one port is echoed on the other one,
  like on a real Minitel.

13162: ARM64 (aarch64) DRC backend [987123879113]
- Updated asmjit to latest master because it has some fixes for ARM64
- Removed the vector-related code from UML and backends. It's not used anywhere that I could find so it's better to just cut it out.
- Added ARM64 (aarch64) DRC backend
It's a big PR. I've done my best to make it work but I'm sure there are still bugs or questionable implementation choices. It passes
  all of the same tests I was doing for the previous DRC changes so I think the outputs should be the same as the other DRC
  backends.
Additional testing and/or misc feedback like benchmarks on various devices would also be appreciated. For hardware I've tested with
  an M1 Pro CPU and a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B. For software I've been testing using a few games on the Naomi (SH4), Firebeat (PPC),
  NWK-TR (PPC), and some very small testing of dgpix (Hyperstone E1-32XT).

AM6070 is the DAC being used in the DMX.
**Questions**
1) Is documentation of the component compatibility enough? Or is the preference to add a `class am6070_device` and
  `DECLARE_DEVICE_TYPE(AM6070, am6070_device)` ?
2) @startaq, just out of curiosity, is the `* 8` below done to improve or avoid aliasing? Or is there some other reason?

13179: macadb: add support for second button of an ADB mouse [as-tb-dev]
This PR adds support for the second button of an ADB mouse
Testing:
Apple IIGS emulation with MAME 0.273 has the following behavior with regards to the second mouse button:
- The "Shift-Command-Clear" combination enables the ADB mouse keypad.  With a ROM 01, this sequence seems to only work if System
  Software is running.  With a ROM 03, it also works if ProDOS is running (probably any OS).
- The "Clear" disables the ADB mouse keypad.
- The keypad 5 key emulates the first mouse button.  This works with both apple2gs (ROM 03) and apple2gsr1 (ROM 01)
- The keypad - key emulates the second mouse button.  This only works with the apple2gs (ROM 03)
- There is no means to generate the second mouse button press using the MAME emulated mouse.
Application support (note, with MAME 0.273, the tests below can only be performed with a ROM 03 Apple IIGS):
- System Software 6.0.1 responds to either of the two mouse buttons.
- The 8-bit MousePaint application only responds to the first mouse button.  This is expected since it is not a IIGS specific
  application.  This test is mostly useful in conjunction with the System Software test to confirm that the two buttons are in
  distinct.
With this PR's change, the second mouse button can be clicked using the actual mouse.  This works works with the ROM 01 IIGS as
  well.

13193: bus/heathzenith/h89: Remove signals not present on a real h89bus [mgarlanger]
Due to unique nature of the H89 bus and how some boards were implemented, additional signals and controls from the CPU board were
  brought to the card, usually by a ribbon cable from a chip socket. Specifically Heath's Z-89-37 and MMS's Double Density
  controller handled the the interrupt processing. This is modeled after the changes made for the SigmaSoft's Parallel Port card and
  IGC in https://github.com/mamedev/mame/pull/13040
This removes fdcirq, fdcdrq, and blockirq signals from the h89bus.

13199: megacd: merge the three software lists into one [chungy]
@cuavas had mentioned on IRC that these lists should be merged, and I spent some hours doing just that. Was it all worth it?
No images have been added nor removed compared to the current HEAD version, but several releases have been renamed and reparented in
  order to merge them all into a singular "megacd" list. The `mdconsole.cpp` file has also been updated to filter the software list
  based on region, so "segacd" only shows American games, "megacdj" only shows Japanese games, "megacd" only shows European games.

13200: minitel2: tune palette to differentiate all colors [fabio-d]
Previously, some distinct levels were mapped to the same color, which made them indistinguishable.
The progression of the gray levels is documented both in the Videotex documentation (STUM1B) and in the TS9347 datasheet, by mapping
  colors to grayscale-equivalent levels.
From STUM1B (page 32):
!stum1b_extract_with_annotated_colors
From the TS9347 datasheet (pages 10 and 19):
!progression1_pag19 !progression2_pag10
Visually tuned with a test pattern (colors.vdt.zip) using a real Minitel as a reference:
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff12c080-4aa5-49da-8b2f-329235b38392" width="45%"/> <img
  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5abe7702-c269-43b9-ae3d-cd1ccd12ca50" width="45%"/>
Note: The number after # is the index in MAME's minitel2 palette
EDIT: For comparison, with the old palette the above test pattern would have been rendered as:
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d769459e-725f-45ca-93a7-dc8cca944249" width="45%"/>
Important: if you test the new palette, in order to actually see the background colors generated by the test pattern, you currently
  have to comment out this line that makes all backgrounds black. Unlike the real chip, the current code makes all backgrounds
  black, unconditionally. A proper fix will follow in a different PR (see also the discussion at
  https://github.com/jfdelnero/minitel/issues/3)

13203: Update m72.cpp - flip bchopper/mrheli Demo Sounds switch [mamehaze]
the current 'on' state just plays a single sound on title screen and no sound in attract
the current 'off' plays full sound in attract
this switches them around so on plays full attract sound

13204: New working machine added [algestam]
----------
Tronica: Diver's Adventure [Milan Galcik, algestam]

13205: ussr/juku: Convert to memory_view, add mouse & fix timer [boamaod]
* Use memory_view instead of address_map_bank_device
* Add juku_mouse_device (joystick like mouse with interrupt)
* Make third PIT8253 clk2 follow the measured ~49.92Hz

13206: oberheim/dmx.cpp: Sound emulation. [m1macrophage]
System transitioned to working with imperfect sound.
While still working on this, it is easier to have related computations together. However, it is possible to cache a lot of the
  computation at voice initialization or triggering. Once the next audio improvements are in (reconstruction filter and voice
  tuning), I'll take care of these optimizations too.

13209: Added emulation for Roland SA sound chips [giulioz]
Adds emulation for the sound chips found in the Roland CPU-B board of SA-synthesis digital pianos (MKS-20, RD1000, ...).
- IC19 R06-0001 (Fujitsu MB60VH142)
- IC9  R06-0002 (Fujitsu MB60V141)
- IC8  R06-0003 (Fujitsu MB61V125)

13212: Adding a layout to the Roland D-70 driver. [felipesanches]
Support moving sliders with mouse click & drag.
* **Note 1:** LEDs declared and positioned in the layout, but the driver still does not control them.
* **Note 2:** The rotary encoder is also not functional yet. I'll leave that one to a future separate commit.

excellent/gcpinbal.cpp:
- Fix background tilemap bankswitching
- Use ROMREGION_ERASE00 for Fill empty ROM area

13214: oberheim/ob8.cpp: Skeleton driver for Oberheim OB8. [m1macrophage]

13215: barcrest\mpu3.cpp: Correct 100hz signal to pia6821 ic3 [blueonesarefaster]
100hz signal to the pia was previously done with m_pia3->cb1_w(~m_signal_50hz);
As m_signal_50hz was an int with a value of 0 or 1 this meant cb1_w() was always being called with a non-zero value.
In addition to the above, it's supposed to be a 100hz signal, not 50hz.
This fixes software which boots and then locks with TURN-ON-DELAY 30 on the display.
Also, fixes software which use the WAI instruction and then lock.

13217: hash/juku: Add E5104 system disks & additional utils disk [boamaod]

Corresponding picture from a real Minitel 2: http://hxc2001.free.fr/minitel/minitel2.jpg (from @jfdelnero's website).
### Explanation
The ef9345.cpp file provides support for both the EF9345 and the TS9347 video chips. Compared to the EF9345, the TS9347 has a
  slightly different logic for the "service row" (i.e. a text line that is conceptually separate from the main contents of the
  screen). In particular:
- the EF9345 lets one select the memory location for fetching data for the service row, but not where to display it (it's always
  displayed at the top of the screen)
- the TS9347 lets one select where to display (either at the top or at the bottom), but not where to fetch it from (it's always
  fetched from the beginning of the video memory block)
Before this change, the TS9347 peculiarities were not implemented. The EF9345 code path is not affected by this change.
Relevant extract from the **EF9345** datasheet (i.e. the one that is already implemented):

13226: heathzenith/h89.cpp: Update gpp handling for MMS FDC [mgarlanger]
For the existing `h89bus_device::io_dispatch_r()` routine, a check of the offset was occurring that made the check in
  `h89_mms_state::port_f2_mms_r` redundant. Between the two checks, having it in h89bus_device simplified the logic.
@rb6502  let me know if you agree with this approach, or if you think the check should removed from
  `h89bus_device::io_dispatch_r()`.

13228: oberheim/dmx.cpp: AA filters, VCA as a device, optimizations, bug fix. [m1macrophage]
- Refactored the gain and decay logic into its own VCA device, to make it easy to add the anti-aliasing filters.
- Added the anti-aliasing / reconstruction filters.
- Optimization: Gain and decay-RC-constant variations computed at initialization.
- Bugfix: voices with pitch control have 1 instead of 3 decay variations. Fixes decay speed in some TOM variations.

13230: ibm5170_cdrom: NT 3.x floppies, SDKs, resource kits, service packs [chungy]
Found clean floppy disk images from MSDN sets, so build 528 of NT 3.1 now has a 5.25" floppy disk for CD-ROM based installs.  Most
  translated versions have their floppy disks for CD-ROM based installs added, too.
MSDN often contained whatever the latest service pack was at the time a set was made, those discs are here now too.  Microsoft was
  cost-conscious of printing many CDs, so these are often combined with other software.  A sole independent Windows NT 3.51 SP4 disc
  has been found and included here.  Were other 3.x service pack CD-ROMs made? Most likely SP5 was, but I have not located one.
Were 3.x service packs released on independent
CD-ROMs from the MSDN sets?  If so, they should replace the entries here.
The resource kit CD-ROMs for 3.1, 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0 are all included here.  These contain companion software to the "Windows NT
  Resource Kit" book that was published.  Even without the book, many of the utilities prove useful for the operating system.
Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6 has been replaced by a properly prepared/shipped disc from Microsoft with an autorun installer.

13232: DRC: Calculate flags for shifts/rotates with a shift of 0 [987123879113]
Discussed this with cuavas already.
The original intention (based on the initial commits of the DRC by Aaron) was for the shift/rotate functions to calculate flags even
  if the shift was 0, but 13-ish years ago it got refactored in a way that made some of the opcodes calculate the flags and some of
  them not calculate the flags if the shift was 0.

13243: CD-i: Fix RLE and Transparency Color Key Bitmask [Vincent-Halver]
This change:
1. Fixes RLE encoding which was short by 50%
2. Color Key now supports bit masking
3. Simplifies code, reducing by >100 lines.
4. Renames Channel to Path to match the Green Book spec.
5. Adds TODO for QHY DYUV images. This image type can't be tested without 625 scanline resolution which is currently blocked. So
  this will remain a known gap until several other features are added.
**Examples games you can use to test this fix:**
All the Fun at the Funfair
Validation Disc (screenshots below).
#### "Before" will always be on the left. "After" will be on the right.
### RL3 Encoding Test
Notice that the flag's triangle is now 2x as wide.
!{A8498C40-A0BB-4E3E-BE02-04F4190B46D1}
### Subscreen Test
Notice that the pointed to line now has uniform size for Red Green and Blue.
!{5F2B5F70-C387-4B56-A224-50EFFC8346F6}
### Color Key Test
In the default case, simply take notice of the RL3 encoded lines are now uniformly sized boxes.
!{94F422EC-E908-4532-9E14-7B73BD70E3E0}
#### The transparency color is 0xff0000 and transparency is set to Inverse. Before, this would mean that only exact match of 0xff
  red would be visible.
With this fix, the transparency mask bits are coded to allow to non-exact match on shade of red. The result of this is that many
  games will likely have more accurate transparency (though I don't know of a game to reference to demonstrate it).
Note: You may notice that the RGB lines do not look right. RGB format decoding is not included in this change, and will be included
  in a future change.

13244: alesis/midiverb.cpp: Routed entire audio path. DSP just a passthrough. [m1macrophage]
- Routed the entire audio path.
- DSP is mostly a passthrough. Just does quantization (ADC) right now.
- Using 'samples' mechanism for audio input.
- Other style and code organization fixes.
It is now possible to "process" audio through the midiverb (see instructions near the top of the driver). There won't be any reverb,
  but there should still be some difference between wet and dry.

13246: CD-i: Add RGB Decoding [Vincent-Halver]
1. This fix adds RGB decoding and RGB Transparency bit. It disables transparency color keying for RGB.
2. It fixes an incorrect enum that was foreshadowed in previous revisions.
As with previous pulls, you can validate this using the Validation Disc (Europe) for the CD-i.
### RGB Scroll Test
Due to the enum for CLUT8 and RGB being the same, this previously decoded as a CLUT8 image. When ICM flag 1 is used on path 1, it is
  instead decoded as RGB.
!{24B08B2F-8C6C-4F60-B01C-57E3D8EA26F2}
### RGB Draw Test
The house is now the right color
!{07289C62-1273-4C22-8A7D-13D5680C3CE2}
### Color Keying Test
RGB is now decoded correctly. Additionally, RGB does not match color key. Even when matching "red" colors, notice that the line of
  RGB still shows red. This is correct behavior, as RGB is not allowed to match color keys.
!{827BF19D-391A-4880-9AC2-BD8BA927D76E}
### Transparency Control (Uncertain Issue)
The implementation of RGB color keying is to always be false. However the spec says that "RGB cannot use color key tests". Since
  this would be a misconfiguration in practice... I am not sure what a true console would produce. The Transparency Control shows a
  different behavior. It's not clear from looking at it whether the change is expected or unexpected.
!{9EA9127F-762D-4546-9183-4BC508D6BAFB}
Despite the last image, this change is much closer to correct spec behavior and it's recommended to pull. Someone with a real
  console should at some point run through all visual tests to get proper reference images.

13255: emscripten: fixes to get bgfx working [algestam]
This PR adds support for the bgfx video backend when building for emscripten.
In order to get bgfx build and run with mame, the following changes has been done:
* `src/osd/modules/render/bgfx/shadermanager.cpp`: Change `make_path_string(...)` to always return the path to the `essl` shaders.
  This wasn't working properly since the call to the function is done before bgfx has been initialised and therefore returned the
  renderer type `Noop` instead (see https://bkaradzic.github.io/bgfx/bgfx.html#_CPPv4N4bgfx15getRendererTypeEv).
* `src/osd/modules/render/drawbgfx.cpp`: Change `set_platform_data(...)` to return platform data with a window handle that includes
  a HTML target selector for the canvas element to use (currently set to `#canvas`).
* `scripts/genie.lua`: Update emscripten compiler flags to match recent emscripten versions and set memory allocation to work with
  the drivers I've been testing with. Also embedded a file, `artwork/lut-default.png`, which is required for the lut and hlsl
  chains.
Additional changes:
* `src/osd/modules/font/font_sdl.cpp`: Change SDL_ttf include to use SDL2 since recent emscripten supports this.
* `docs/source/initialsetup/compilingmame.rst`: Update emscripten version to use.
The change has been tested by me and works well with the drivers I've tested. The performance is greatly improved when using bgfx
  compared to the soft renderer and many drivers that struggled to maintain a decent framerate are now running smoothly at 100%.
!image
All builds has been done using emscripten 3.1.35. When trying later versions various other issues has been encountered which I
  haven't addressed or investigated further.
Setting this as a draft and ask kindly for other Mame developers with more insight into the OSD and build system to please take a
  look at this PR and suggest how these changes can be improved.

13286: Fixes for MC68EZ328 [isotherm]
In the course of fleshing out the AlphaSmart 3000 emulation, I've made these two changes to more accurately emulate the underlying
  hardware. They are separate commits to help in case of future regression testing.
- The Port A change should have no impact on existing emulation, as none of the machines (cowtipping, iqunlim, clie_db, palm) use
  port A.
- The timer change should be functionally equivalent, though the timer tick callback will be called more often. It might affect
  emulation speed on very low power host systems.

13307: cpu/drcbearm64.cpp: Optimise load/store and call generation [cuavas]
This should implement some of the optimisations previously discussed for AArch64 code generation:
* `bl` displacement is in words
* The `emit_*_mem` functions know the operand size, so they can pass the corresponding shift to `emit_ldr_str_base_mem` rather than
  trying to calculate it after the fact
* An immediate load/store offset can be either a 9-bit signed byte offset or an unsigned 12-bit element offset
* An unsigned 12-bit element offset can always reach an entire page, so the page-relative access can always be done in two
  instructions
And one bug fix:
* AArch64 doesn’t allow a variable left shift for a register offset, it only allows zero or the element size, so there’s no point
  testing intermediate shift values.
@987123879113 and/or @rb6502 can you check this out and test it?

13319: oberheim_dmx.lay: Proper tracking of pointer IDs. Easier fine adjustments. [m1macrophage]
- Click and adjustment state is now tracked for each pointer ID individually, rather than globally.
- If a user selects the slider knob, the adjustment will be proportional to the knob movement. This allows for finer adjustments. If
  the user clicks elsewhere on the slider, the adjustment is based on the absolute position of the click.
This is a followup to the discussion in #13177.  Tested on a single-mouse setup.
This should also work with multiple pointer devices, and touchscreens (assuming the latter generate "button press" events). But I
  was not able to verify. I tried testing with multiple mouse cursors (using `xinput` and multiple mice), but it seems like SDL2
  does not support that. I also tried emulating a touchscreen with `evdev`, but this didn't work either. If someone has  a way to
  test multiple cursors or emulate a touchscreen on linux, let me know. Alternatively, if someone with a touchscreen can validate,
  that would be great!

13325: cpu/drcbex64.cpp: Directly dispatch memory accesses to specific handlers [cuavas]
At the urging of @galibert, this makes the x86-64 recompiler back-end dispatch memory accesses to specific handlers directly,
  avoiding one level of out-of-line function calls.  From my testing on an Intel 8th generation i7, the performance improvement is
  measurable, but less than 5% at best.
I’d like people to test this with other x86-64 CPUs (e.g. AMD or different generations of Intel CPUs) to see what kind of difference
  it makes (if any).
If it does seem to produce a useful improvement, I can follow up by adding code to directly dispatch reads smaller than native
  width, and add scaffolding for carrying over the same optimisations to AArch64.  If it doesn’t seem to be a worthwhile
  improvement, I’ll just move across the removal of the static address space accessors and ditch the recompiler changes.

13328: konami/mystwarr_v.cpp, k053246_k053247_k055673.cpp: improve sprite blending [FredYeye]
This pull request is split into three commits:
1. d0faecd
The sprite effect attribute bits in mystwarr, metamrph and viostorm are used for sprite blending purposes. I changed the sprite
  callbacks to attach the attribute bits.
2. e7f911e
Blending was being done in reverse. There are probably several reasons why this was never noticed, but two reasons would be that 0%
  and 100% blending worked as intended and almost no games use sprite blending (at least in current MAME). Simple solution: reverse
  the operands to *alpha_blend_r32()*.
3. 8184130
Optional commit: minor cleanup of *zdrawgfxzoom32GP()*, the function that contains the *alpha_blend_r32()* calls. Initially I had
  planned to make bigger changes, like condensing the switch-cases, but I wasn't satisfied with my attempts at doing so. Instead I
  opted for a more conservative cleanup pass. It appears to give a marginal speedup as a bonus.
This is the least important commit of the three, so if it's deemed unnecessary it can be dropped.
---
This fixes transparent sprites in mystwarr, metamrph and viostorm. Mystwarr & viostorm make little use of these; it's a bit more
  apparent in metamrph.
I assume this affects other systems too - like konami GX? I ran all GX games with -bench 400 and didn't run into any sprites that
  use any transparency. Either GX games do not have transparent sprites or they're not tagged as such in current MAME. This is
  hardly the perfect testing method, so please let me know if I should be testing any other games and systems.

- Working dual-processor system that can boot both NEWS-OS 2 and NEWS-OS 4
- Basic peripherals work (serial, SCSI, networking kinda)
- Lots of custom stuff that has been partially reverse-engineered like the front panel and the custom MMU
Lowlights:
- Networking stability is bad
- The amount of custom stuff means that this driver has a lot more educated guesses in it than the NEWS r3k, r4k, and
  single-processor 68k drivers do.
- NEWS-OS 4 installer uses unemulated tape drive commands, so the OS install process doesn't work right now. Instead, I used a
  script I wrote a while back to generate an image from the bitsavers dump of NEWS-OS 4.1C:
  https://github.com/briceonk/news-os/tree/master/src/news-inst
- The SCSI DMA setup is really hacky (just like the Macintosh stuff) because `iopboot` uses the features of the 68k that allow it to
  use narrower buses to do longword transactions

13380: k053936.cpp: invert blending, reduce code duplication [FredYeye]
The quest to improve blending on Konami systems continue.
A rather simple change once again: blending appears to be performed backwards in k053936.cpp's `K053936GP_copyroz32clip()`. I tried
  a few games that use this chip, but I only observed transparency in two games: `mmaulers` (planet fade-in in the intro) and
  `gaiapols` (water, glass floor). The visual changes are pretty minor from what I've seen, but it's a step forward nonetheless.
I also combined solid / alpha drawing paths to reduce duplicate code.
Another thing I tried was to convert the do loops to more conventional for loops, along with the usual nailing everything down with
  const and more appropriate types. This lost some performance, so decided to only commit the bare minimum for now.

Computer the Golf (1983)(Nihon Falcom) [shawnji on archive.org]

-Fixes for MC68EZ328 (#13286) [Kirk Meyer]
 * MC68EZ328: Allow selection and use of Port A
   - On EZ and VZ, PASEL is reserved, and it was hard-coded to 0 (disabled). However, the user manual notes: "In an 8-bit-only
      system, you can configure these pins as a parallel I/O port by writing a 1 to the WDTH8 bit of the SCR."
   - According to the MC68328 datasheet, something similar should be needed to activate its Port B, but that change is not included
      here. Its PBSEL is exposed, so there is likely no difference in emulation.
 * MC68EZ328: Fuller implementation of timer
   - The existing implementation left the timer counter (TCN) at zero until the compare value (TCMP) was reached. However, some
      software relies on reading the TCN values to measure elapsed time.
   - The timer counter (TCN) now increments on every timer tick.
