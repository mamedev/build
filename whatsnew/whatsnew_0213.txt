-Refactored info_xml_creator::output() [npwoods]
 * The two variations of output() no longer duplicate logic
 * No longer relying on driver_enumerator::config() to create machine_config objects.  Because driver_enumerator would cache all
    objects created, we would needlessly hog memory

-simplify Atomiswave key scheduling, get rid of 20bit key files [MetalliC]

 * Created an emu.register_mandatory_file_manager_override() LUA function to allow LUA plugins to substitute the mandatory file
    manager

-juku: Floppy now (partially) works [Dirk Best]
 * The CPU tries to read data in a tight loop, so there must be some way for it to be halted until data is ready. The current
    solution works good enough to boot CP/M.
 * Also:
 * Change FDC to KR1818VG93
 * Change disk format from 3.5" to 5.25"
 * Add single sided disk format
 * Add softlist

-Changed info_xml_creator to use std::ostream [npwoods]

 * out of whatsnew: Add in PCB locations for Birdie Try and correct ROM labels and document the PCB combo

-segasp: Tetris Giant security PIC dumped [CoolFox]

-Add still-frame PNG image device for use by digitizers/cameras/etc. [R. Belmont]
 * Other formats can be added, we already have libjpeg in 3rdparty/.

-Revert "nscsi_cd: make sgi cdrom identify as hard disk" [AJR]
 * This stops indy_4610 from failing its SCSI test.
 * This reverts commit 2e25d99be689cd1b5ce19ef5529d36c474fdcb62.

-wd33c9x - clarify hardware reset [tyfighter]
 * Hardware reset triggers a SCSI_STATUS_RESET interrupt when the MR signal is asserted, but this is also true when the device first
    powers on. Move the interrupt generation to device_reset so all hardware resets trigger the interrupt.

-apple2: Support the original gameport ComputerEyes [R. Belmont, Golden Child]

-dec0.cpp: dumped PROMs for the dec0 motherboard [Guru]

-m65c02, r65c02: Correct memory access patterns for read-modify-write instructions [AJR]
 * The extra operand cycle in CMOS versions becomes a dummy read rather than a writeback, and page boundaries do not figure into
    cycle timings for indexed modes.

-Correct audio CPU for The Deep [MASH]
 * The Deep uses a Rockwell R65C02 CPU for sound. See PCB (top right cpu)
    http://adb.arcadeitalia.net/media/mame.current/pcbs/thedeep.png

-mephisto_modular: Added newer Portorose 32 Bit program ROM. [Berger]

-gdbstub: added new GDB stub debugger (#5456) [Ramiro Polla]
 * gdbstub: added new GDB stub debugger
 * This debugger can be used to connect to an external debugger that communicates using the GDB Remote Serial Protocol, such as GDB
    itself or many other GDB frontends.
 * Currently i386 (ct486), arm7 (gba), and ppc (pmac6100) are supported.
 * gdbstub: enable GDB stub debugger in mac and windows builds

-gdbstub: add z80 and m6502 [Ramiro Polla]
 * z80 was tested with pacman and m6502 was tested with apple2e.
 * Side-effects must be disabled before reading memory, otherwise apple2e starts failing after the first read to 0xc080.
 * Since GDB doesn't support those processors, I made up the features name with "mame.<cpuname>". I also had to choose the registers
    to export in the target.xml file, and since I don't have any experience with these processors I don't know if I made the best
    choice.

-Correct Acrobatic Dog-Fight sound chip type (#5462) [MASH]
 * Correct sound chip type
 * Acrobatic Dog-Fight uses 2x YM2149 for sound: See http://www.wolfgangrobel.de/arcadetalk/img_pcbs/acrobatic_dog_fight_01.jpg
    http://www.citylan.it/wiki/index.php/Acrobatic_Dog-Fight_(US)
 * Small device description fix
 * All devices in MAME use an "x" as a multiplier: AT28C16 2Kx8 EEPROM ER2055 EAROM (64x8) Parallel EEPROM 2804 (512x8)...

-tmnt.cpp:  Fix input port configuration to allow player start buttons to work for tmnt24pu.  Fixes MT#7396 [Scott Stone]

-birdtry: Hook up newly dumped MCU, remove simulation [Dirk Best]
 * Promoted to working as result.

-cosmac: Add disassembler support for CDP1805 with extended instruction set [AJR]

-toplevel makefile: fix 'cleansrc' target for Unix/Linux [Christian Groessler]

-cosmac: Use conventional decimal numbering for registers [AJR]

-pce.cpp: add support for Tennokoe Bank extended Backup RAM [Angelo Salese]

-New working clone [braintro]

-wd_fdc: add a SSO callback. [68bit]
 * Some machines do not connect the SSO output to control the floppy side. When this new callback option is used the wd_fdc no
    longer controls the floppy, rather calls the SSO callback.

-SS-30: add support for the MP-T timer / counter card. [68bit]
 * E.g. this can be used SWTPC FLEX for a timer tick.

-swtpc09: add a UniFLEX specific floppy format. [68bit]
 * The UniFLEX disk format is not compatible with the Flex format. Significantly it does not use a mix of single density for booting
    on some double density disks which makes it simpler - hardware required a new boot ROM to run UniFLEX. Further, the UniFLEX
    sector size is 512 bytes versus 256 for Flex, and the UniFLEX 'SIR' info sector record is completely different to the info on
    Flex disk, and the file system format is also not at all compatible.
 * Thus the UniFlex format can rely largely on the WD17xx format, with an overload to handle the sector numbering on the second side
    continuing from the first side (one feature in common with the Flex format). This gives a quick 'save' capability and shares
    code.
 * Support for 8" disks is included as this was the initial distribution format and the only one found so far.

-flex floppy dsk: rewrite to be based on the wd177x dsk format [68bit]
 * This now works with both single density and double density floppy disks, and dynamically identifies boot sector IDs required for
    6800 booting, and supports writing back to the 'dsk' image files.

-nmk16.cpp : Reduce duplicates, Add notes for screen raw params [cam900]

-Ensuring that devices emitted by -listxml are sorted [npwoods]
 * This is primarily to make the output be deterministic.

-thedeep: Hook up MCU, remove simulation [Dirk Best]

-Added compile time define to use joystick/buttons inputs in Athena no… (#5464) [Damian Rogers]
 * Added compile time define to use joystick/buttons inputs in Athena no Hatena
 * Changed solution to use PORT_CONDITION instead of compiler definition per suggestion from MAME dev

-315_5313.cpp DMA / Timer Updates, Correct refresh rate and timer rate related to systems when using mega drive VDP (#5470) [cam900]
 * Correct timer rate related to screen refresh rate for 315_5313.cpp, megacd.cpp, mega32x.cpp 315_5313.cpp : Simplify DMA behavior,
    Add notes, Simplify handlers, Fix spacing, Reduce unnecessary lines, Use shorter / correct type values, Fix debugger issue
    megadriv.cpp, segac2.cpp, calcune.cpp : Correct screen refresh rate, Add notes (source :
    https://segaretro.org/Sega_Mega_Drive/Technical_specifications) megadriv.cpp : Allow Z80 VDP reading, Correct VDP sound output
    calcune.cpp : Fix naming, Add notes
 * 315_5313.cpp : Reduce unnecessary lines, Fix spacings
 * 315_5313.cpp : Use struct for nametable, Reduce duplicates, Fix spacing, Reduce unnecessary lines
 * 315_5313.cpp : Fix spacing
 * 315_5313.cpp : Fix spacing, Reduce duplicates, Unnecessary lines, Fix type values

-Enable precompiled header usage in the Visual Studio compiler (#5473) [S.Z]
 * Enable precompiled header usage in the Visual Studio compiler But only for libraries emu frontend precompile dasm optional Also
    add emu.h include to hpcdasm.cpp
 * Include emu.h in some disassembler sources to use precompiled headers
 * Remove debug message

-Add BASIC Thomson tokenizer (#5479) [hadess]
 * [Imgtool] Add write support for Thomson BASIC
 * [Imgtool] Fix passing --filter= to imgtool get command
 * This command should work: imgtool get thom_fd inondation-d-additions.fd INONDATI.BAS TEST.BAS --filter=thombas7 as it matches the
    expected syntax: Usage: imgtool get <format> <imagename> <filename> [newname] [--filter=filter] [--fork=fork] but does not
    because imgtool fewer "maxargs".
 * Increase the maximum number of arguments by 2 to cater for --filter and
 * -fork being passed.
   - [Imgtool] Fix handling multiple tokens in BASIC tokenizer
 * The line: 10 LIMIT$=STR$(LIMIT(N)) was not getting tokenised properly because the loop looking for tokens wasn't exited and
    consumed consecutive tokens.
 * So $ was getting detected, token_shift and token_value were set, the cursor position got incremented, then = got detected on the
    next iteration of the loop.
 * We should instead exit the loop, and write what we already have.
 * Closes: #5478

-mc68hc11: Add internal latches and direction registers for ports [AJR]
 * Split up hc11_regs_r/w into many separate handlers
 * Give each MC68HC11 model its own specific io_map
 * Remove now-unnecessary readback handlers from skeetsht.cpp and taitojc.cpp

-SS-30 MP-S2: Dual Serial Interface [68bit]
 * For the SWTPC09.

-pc9801.cpp: proper support for MEMSW device [Angelo Salese]

-ti99: Changed busmouse to a push behaviour; the real V9938 does not regularly poll the mouse but lets it update an internal
 counter. Also rerouted the extra mouse button to a separate input line. [Michael Zapf]

-forgot.... [Roberto Fresca]

-New skeleton driver: SNES 4 Slot arcade switcher [Dirk Best]
 * Credits: ClawGrip, Roberto Fresca, Recreativas.org, Dumping Union, System11, Dirk Best
 * This is based on an MCS-51 core, like the MK3 bootleg. They are clearly based on the same code, so the MK3 bootleg was moved to
    this driver.

-SS-30 PIA IDE hard disk interface [68bit]
 * Split out the PIA IDE hard disk interface from the swtpc09 machine. This support appears to have been incomplete or to have bit
    rotten, and has been updated and tested lightly with FLEX9.

-Moved most of the implementation of info_xml_creator to anonymous namespaces [npwoods]
 * This is to keep things isolated to a single translation unit as much as possible

-dec0: Label Birdie Try as revision 2 in case someone ever finds an earlier version & other misc doc updates [braintro]

-amstrad: add Ram Electronics Music Machine MIDI and sampler expansion. [Barry Rodewald]

-SS-30 DC5 floppy disk interface [68bit]
 * Split out the floppy disk controller from the swtpc09 machine, adding it to the ss50 interface. The DC5 is compatible with both
    the SWTPC 6800 and 6809 systems, supporting the 4 and 16 byte I/O interfaces respectively, via a jumper setting, so can be used
    on the MAME swtpc and swtpc09 machines. The DC5, like the DC4, supports double sided and density disks, and claimed backward
    compatibility with the DC1, DC2 and DC3.

-Changes LUA seq_poll_start to take the input_item_class as a string (#5503) [npwoods]
 * This seems to work around a problem that (at least for me) caused the 'sol::object seq' parameter to not properly handle a
    specified sol::user<input_seq>.
 * This problem could be reproduced with the following command at the LUA console:
 * manager:machine():input():seq_poll_start("absolute", manager:machine():input():seq_from_tokens("KEYCODE_Q"))
 * I would feel more comfortable if I understood why the existing code failed; it isn't clear to me if this is a bug in our sol
    handling for input_item_class, a bug in sol itself, or a compiler bug, but this change works for me and should definitely not
    introduce any problems.

-unidasm: Add score7, unsp12 and unsp20 support [AJR]

-SS-30 DC5: drive select inhibit; dynamic clock rates; motor timer updates. [68bit]
 * Bit 7 of the control register inhibits all drive select lines when high and this is now implemented. This was a long standing
    feature in this line of floppy disk controller boards. The drives are also inhibited when the motor timer has timed out. It is
    not just their motors that are off.
 * Add a conf option to interpret bit 7 of the control register as an 'erroneous' side select, and log such usage. Some drivers use
    bit 7 for side selection and this option help work around them and adapt them.
 * Add support to set the clock rate using the DC5 extended control register, and update the associated code. The clock rate config
    option is now only an 'expected' rate and may be null.
 * Clarify that the motor timer is only triggered by access to the FDC registers and not by access to the control registers. There
    appears to be a common error in drivers, they access the control register and then wait a period, and it appears they wait for
    the motor to spin up, but that can not happen. The problem appears to be documented, flaky disk booting, having to reset and try
    again and again. It seems best to deal with that in boot and driver software rather than an emulator hack.
 * The motors are on, or off, irrespective of drive selection.
 * Rewrite the updating of the floppy and FDC state based on the control register and the motor timer out, so that the latched
    control register state is respected when the motor timer output changes - it had been just turning the motors on or off but the
    drive selection also needs to be updated.
 * Reset the DDEN input, setting it for single density, upon device reset.
 * Default DC5 to 16 byte address mode to suit the SWTPC 6809 - the SWTPC 6800 overrides this default for it's 4 byte address mode.
 * Indentation fixes.

-sbrkout.cpp: verified main CPU clock [Guru]

-SWTPC - add floppy disk support (#5513) [68bit]
 * ss-30 mps: default to 9600 baud
 * SWTPC - add floppy disk support
 * Include the DC5 floppy disk controller on the expected SS-30 I/O positions of ports 5 and 6.
 * Add a config option to select the CPU clock rate. Higher FDC clock rates need higher CPU rates to download the data fast enough
    without DMA.
 * A couple of SWTBUG ROM patch config options are added to make disk booting more practical.
 * Narrow the address range block used for the motherboard I/O to 0x8000 to 0x8fff, and also narrow the mirroring to potentially
    support two mother boards with twice as many I/O cards. Add documentation to explain these changes.
 * Make 32K the default lower RAM size.
 * Implement RAM from 0xa000 to 0xdfff, as FLEX needs much of that.
 * Document the path to supporting Low and High PROMS.
 * Emit a 9600 baud rate clock on the 150/9600 line. This was a practical rate at the time and screen based software is not
    practical at the prior rate of 1200 baud. This was a document option.
 * The emulator now runs FLEX 2 on a range of disk formats. Disk driver software support is still an issue, another monitor PROM
    might be needed, there might be an issue with the FDC 'ready' input, but this is a big step forward.

-swtpc09: update, use the SS-30 bus, get these working. [68bit]
 * Add support for the SS-30 bus. The DC5 FDC, MPS2, PIA-IDE and MPT have been added to the SS-30 bus and are split out.
 * A separate floppy format has been added for UniFLEX, and the FLEX format has been improved. These formats should be usable now,
    and have been lightly tested.
 * The banked memory was not implemented correctly and has been updated.
 * The DMAF2 and DMAF3 FDCs are still implemented in the swtpc09 device, but have been updated. These belong on the SS-50 bus, but
    there is no SS-50 bus yet - still on the TODO list.
 * The PIA IDE has been implemented on the SS-30 bus, and updated to get it working, and the swtpc09i machine is promoted to
    working. Have been able to boot this from a FLEX hard disk image, and it also boots FLEX using the DC5 FDC.
 * Tested swtpc09 running FLEX with DMAF2 support. Tested swtpc09d3 running UniFLEX and it seems to run well. The hard disk support
    is still TODO, but added a reference to the WD1000 documentation. Did not have a UniFLEX image on hand to test the swtpc09u, but
    have tested the DMAF2 under FLEX and UniFLEX using DMAF3 so it's probably ok or close. Had no documentation for the DMAF3.

-Resolve [[nodiscard]] warning from c_str() call. [Billy Robert O'Neal III]
 * In C++98/03, basic_string::c_str() was allowed to be a reallocation to insert the null terminator. MAME is ensuring this actually
    happens with a do-nothing call to c_str().
 * In C++11 and later, this is prohibited, and the string is mandated to be always null terminated. As a result Visual C++ marks
    c_str() with [[nodiscard]], triggering a warning here for discarding the result.
 * (I don't know of any C++03 implementation that actually reallocates here, but just in case this code actually targeted such an
    implementation I've just suppressed the warning for now. If MAME only targets C++11 or later, we should fix it by deleting the
    line.)

-Spectrum betadisk stuff renamed the beta128 support from beta.cpp to beta128.cpp for now added basic devices for the older beta
 models, which seem to fall into 3 basic groups 1. Handmade version using V2 ROM and FD1771 controller 2. Production version using
 V3 ROM and FD1793 controller 3. 'Plus' version with more refined features, Magic Button and V4 ROM (closest to the beta128)
 [DavidHaywood]
 * there are a number of hardware clones of these for different systems, which are not compatible, and will eventually need adding
    as their own devices.
 * note, these new devices are NOT working, as the disable mechanism for the ROM is not clear to me, and the remaining mappings not
    confirmed.  It does not appear to rely on executing code from RAM to disable like the Beta128, despite some sites claiming so?
 * it might be possible, later, to reintegrate the beta128 as a further extension of the betaplus, but until the remaining details
    of these original devices is worked out it's cleaner to keep them apart.
 * also added some notes about suspicious behavior with even the beta128 hookup that points at something potentially being wrong
    (the emulation of the pentagon machines with integrated support don't suffer from the same issue)

-wd_fdc: add a SSO callback. Some machines do not connect the SSO output to control the floppy side. When this new callback option
 is used the wd_fdc no longer controls the floppy, rather calls the SSO callback. E.g. a SWTPC DC4 or DC5 FDC uses SSO to control
 the density, by inverting the SSO output and connecting that to the DDEN input, and this support is needed there. [68bit]

-luaengine.cpp: Exposed ioport_manager::type_group() and ioport_field::keyboard_codes(). [npwoods]

-Refactored info_xml_creator::output() [npwoods]
 * The two variations of output() no longer duplicate logic
 * No longer relying on driver_enumerator::config() to create machine_config objects.  Because driver_enumerator would cache all
    objects created, we would needlessly hog memory

-Created an -attach_window command line parameter on Windows to attach to an existing window This allows a front end (like
 BletchMAME) to provide the window and the MAME executable's job is to merely write over it.  This disabling functionality that is
 nonsensical on a window that you don't own (like the WNDPROC), and also some changes to how focus is identified and the DirectInput
 code works. [npwoods]
 * I would really welcome feedback from non-Win32 people here, because it isn't clear how this should work on other platforms.  I'm
    also not religious about how the precise command line argument works (perhaps it should have some sort of "scheme" qualifier,
    like '-attach_window hwnd:0x12345678)
 * When this change is merged, it will be possible (by virtue of the worker_ui LUA plugin) to use BletchMAME on an off the shelf
    version of MAME.

 * Currently i386 (ct486), arm7 (gba), ppc (pmac6100), z80, and m6502 are supported.
 * Side-effects must be disabled before reading memory, otherwise apple2e starts failing after the first read to 0xc080.
 * As GDB doesn't support some of the relevant processors, the feature names are bespoke.

-sdk85.cpp: Added default mastermind image for a15 option rom bank and empty BIOS ROM image by Peter Naszvadi [retrohun]

-Added compile time define to use joystick/buttons inputs in Athena no Hatena [RyogaMasaki]
 * Athena no Hatena uses four buttons whose bits are actually equivalent to the joystick input on the other games on this system.
    However, the hidden "Test Program" menu makes use of the standard stick/3-button input layout. With the standard input mapping,
    the menus are unusable as the three SHOT buttons are unmapped. Building with ATEHATE_DEBUG defined will use the standard
    joystick/button mapping for working with the debug functions.
