Source Changes
--------------
Converted amiga drivers to use driver_devices. Merged common code
between legacy Amiga and AGA video systems. [Atari Ace]

Death to more NVRAM_HANDLERS. [Aaron Giles]

cdda - Added a per-channel volume setting function [Barry Rodewald]

M68k: Add more conditionals and FGETEXP instruction [R. Belmont]

Converted x2212 to a modern device. Changed x2212 device to return 
unmapped bits for the upper 4 bits. Added e2prom address space to 
x2212 so that the latched contents can be viewed. Updated starwars 
and firefox. Hooked up x2212 in foodf. [Aaron Giles]

Changed ccastles and cloud9 to use the x2212 instead of the hacked-up
fake version they had. [Aaron Giles]

Enable vertical scroll bars in debugger comboboxes, and resize them to
show the full text. [Aaron Giles]

Changed memory width stubs to fill unpopulated regions with the
appropriate portion of the unmap value. [Aaron Giles]

Added ER2055 device. Changed liberator over to using it. Other Atari
games to follow. [Aaron Giles]

Modernized liberator driver, added save state support. Moved
generalized EAROM handling to atarigen. [Aaron Giles]

Added new (modern) address map macros for referencing member functions
in base classes: AM_READ_BASE(_class, _member), AM_WRITE_BASE,
AM_READWRITE_BASE, etc. [Aaron Giles]

Debugger (SDL) : Window locations in the SDL debugger are now saved
and loaded at exit and startup. [Andrew Gardner]

Modified Z80-DMA reset command (C3) to not randomly clear registers.
[Curt Coder]

raiden2: checkpoint current state [Olivier Galibert]

Removed IRQ hack in Niyanpai HW [Angelo Salese]

Ported over CD-i cleanup from MESS. [Harmony]

Put the SH2 DMA on a timer.  This is needed because Knuckles Chaotix
on the 32X can't be done with 'Instant DMA' due the SH2 DMA is used to
read from a FIFO port which is being filled by the 68k during the
transfer.  [David Haywood]

Fixed 8-bit dram (framebuffer) access for 32x [David Haywood]

Added sprite buffering to Mirage Youjuu Mahjongden, confirmed by a
real PCB video [Angelo Salese]

680x0: '030 MMU now emulates translation cache; fixed misinterpreted
MMU opcodes [R. Belmont]

Megadrive: changed way the z80 window into 68k space works so that it
automatically can handle things like the 32x. [David Haywood]

Improvements to Piccolo Poker 100. [Roberto Fresca]
 * Added a workaround to get the game booting.
 * Created inputs from the scratch.
 * Promoted to 'working'.
 * Added technical and game notes.

Fixed Fairchild F8 CPU interrupt handling. [Curt Coder]

Implemented support for SH-2 cycle steal mode, used by Fever Soccer
[David Haywood]

Fixed a SH-2 with TSTM opcode [R.Belmont]

Neo-Geo updates [Johnboy]:
 * savagere, kizuna - Reverted C1 change from u2 (chip was bad, C1 was
    correct)
 * gururin - Added correct M1 ROM
 * quizdai2 - Tagged as MVS and AES version
 * Started to document mask ROM types

naomi.c: Added Mamonoro cartridge description [f205v]

viper.c: Added the 941a01 BIOS and p911e missing NVRAM dump
[John Bud @ Jamma+]

Golden Poker driver updates... [Roberto Fresca]
 * Added 3 new Witch Card sets.
 * Added 3 new Falcons Wild sets (from 3 different hardwares).

 * Partially decrypted the second CPU program from Falcon hardware.
 * Figured out the Falcons Wild (Video Klein) memory map and machine.
 * Defeated the evil Video Klein's Witch Card hardware.
 * Reworked inputs for some sets.
 * Added lamps layouts/connections to the new sets.
 * Figured out the multiplexed data/address from Falcon's boards
    sound.
 * Added full sound support to Falcon hardware.
 * Reorganized and partially cleaned-up the driver.
 * Added more technical notes.

Fixed unaligned 16 and 32-bit i/o accesses in i386 CPU core
[Barry Rodewald]

Fix bug where multiple sampleof attributes could be output, resulting
in invalid XML. [Aaron Giles]

Enable wavwrite (and aviwrite) sound even if -nosound is specified.
[Aaron Giles]

Since PNG writing is used for MNG as well, switch back to default
compression instead of best compression in order to keep the
performance reasonable. [Aaron Giles]

Fix another Clang issue [Balrog]

SH2DRC: Fix BSRF and JSR so delay slot insns can trash the calculated
PR if they want [R. Belmont]

v9938 - Set default value for status register 4 and 6  [Michael Zapf]

Added INT1, INT2, INT3, DRQ0, DRQ1, TMRIN0, TMRIN1 input and TMROUT0,
TMROUT1 output lines to the Intel 80186 CPU interface. [Curt Coder]

SH2: fix PC relative MOV in delay slot
SH2: Further improvements to PC_relative loads in the delay slot.
[R. Belmont]

Improvements to vpoker.c driver [Roberto Fresca]
 * Added 5-Aces Poker.
 * Fixed, improved and merged memory map.
 * Fixed the ROM loading.
 * Removed the mame rnd hack from the blitter read handler.
 * Preliminary inputs.
 * Fixed visible screen.

Added new driver for NSM TMS9995 based hardware. [Roberto Fresca]

Added UART Tx/Rx framework to the CD-i 68070 implementation, necessary
for Quizard protection. [Harmony] Changed default CD-i SLAVE video
setting to PAL, necessary for Quizard to boot. [Harmony]

Naomi: added protection key for gundmct, it boots now [Cah4e3]

Changed visible area and resolution of CD-i based arcade games.
[Harmony] 

Got Quizard 1.7 to boot with a targeted hack. Still not
playable. [Harmony]

New driver for Advanced Video Technology (AVT) platform
[Roberto Fresca]
 * Almost accurate memory map.

 * Hooked the AY-3-8910.
 * Added games notes.
 * Added technical notes.

Patched out the majority of the Quizard 1.7 protection check and
emulated the game's inputs. [Harmony]

Patched out the majority of the Quizard 1.2 protection check and
made the patch more generic. [Harmony]

Added incomplete protection patches to Quizard 3.2 and Quizard Rainbow
4.1; both now run through attract mode and coin up, but crash when
going in-game. [Harmony]

video/neogeo.c: Call optimize_sprite_data() at VIDEO_RESET (for the
convenience of Neo Geo CD) [Barry Rodewald]

Attempt to untie the shared mapping for all games in zr107.c (midnrun,
windheat, waveshrk).  Buttons now have labels and match up to test
mode, even if you cannot play the games.  [Tafoid]

Fixed vspinbalj (vsnes.c) flipper control and eliminated duplicated
inputs. [Tafoid]

Converted render.c objects into C++ objects. Updated all callers.
[Aaron Giles]

Improvements to Subsino driver. [Roberto Fresca]
 * Created proper inputs for all Victor 6 sets.
 * Fixed/extended Magic Train technical notes.
 * Eliminated the 3 undumped bipolar PROMs from Magic Train since
    these are in fact Darlington Arrays instead of bipolar PROMs.

Replaced the excessively large Quizard patch scheme with a much
smaller 4-byte patch plus basic protection obfuscation simulation.
[Harmony]

Found the appropriate patch values for Quizard 2.2 and promoted it
to working. [Harmony]

Removed RAM protection patches from Quizard games.  All games now at
least boot with simulated protection, and the ones that were playable
before remain playable. [Harmony]

Changes LIVES to use only a single DIP instead of being split up
between two input ports by using a CUSTOM_INPUT. 
[Tafoid, Fabio Priuli]

Eliminated non-functioning service mode mapping which was a duplicate
(ssridersb - tmnt.c).  Added new labels to bombkick (yunsun16.c) to
better describe the status required for each DIP, rather than the
duplicate label "DON"T CHANGE IT!". [Tafoid]

8237dma.c: Initialize the command register to 0 on reset. 
[Wilbert Pol]

Update psx drivers to use a driver_device. [Atari Ace]

Update driver-specific sound devices to use tokens and store their
state like other devices. [Atari Ace]
