MAMETesters Bugs Fixed
----------------------
- 03403: [DIP/Input] rollfr_2: Can't init Roll Fruit game. (MetalliC)
- 03458: [Sound] bzone and clones: Broken engine sound (couriersud)



Source Changes
--------------
Added genuine sets of Rally-X and New Rally-X [Team Japump!!!]

discrete_sound_r now can inquiry any node: [couriersud]
 - the return type is UINT8, consequently the designer needs to ensure
    that the node delivers adequately scaled data.
 - input nodes allow the input data to be scaled. The return value is 
    the node value *after* scaling.

DISCRETE_74LS624 - optimized for some more speed. [Derrick Renaud]

DISCRETE_566 - started making a more accurate simulation based on 
testing of a real IC. This makes the rest of Sky Raider sounds work.
[Derrick Renaud]

Completed dump of Gun Survivor 2 cart [Guru]

Hacked in the dsp56156's "Long Interrupts."  Added SUB opcode. 
Polygonet Commanders now goes in-game! [Andrew Gardner]

plygonet.c: hooked up 53936 roz layer. [R. Belmont, David Haywood]

Fleshed out SCC68070 definition in m68k core, for CD-i use in MESS 
[Harmony]

m68k: disassemble PMOVE instruction (move to/from PMMU). [R. Belmont]

exp is slow, but pow is even slower [couriersud]
 - more LS624 optimization, replace pow(10, x) by pow10(x)
 - mixer loop optimizations

Impromved discrete performance for mario: [couriersud]
 - pow to exp : 5%
 - parallel tasks : 45%
 - minor tweaks

M680x0 update: [R. Belmont]
 - Add CPU types 68EC030, 68030, and 68EC040
 - Start of 030/040 PMMU, including stubbed PMOVE

Fixed up RAM bank names to prevent crashes with memdump. Extended 
explicit banks to 96. [Aaron Giles]

multfish.c driver fixes and improvements: [MetalliC]
 - Hooked up inputs for Roll Fruit
 - Added hopper emulation, payout now works
 - Added information on how to initialize Roll Fruit
 - Added in missing rom to a few MultiFish sets

DISCRETE_555_MSTABLE - optimized speed and added new operating modes.
[Derrick Renaud]

Fixed ROM name of warpwarp. Also removed 4th program ROM which is not 
present on real board. [Team Japump!!!]

Memory references can now explicitly specify logical or physical 
access by prepending with an 'l' or 'p'. Logical remains the default. 
Example: ppb@1000 = physical program space byte at address $1000. 
ldw@2000 = logical data space word at address $2000. Changed cheat
finder to explicitly reference physical memory when writing out new
cheats. [Aaron Giles]

Added simple system for auto-detecting cheat-worthy RAM areas.
[Sandro Ronco]

Added NULL check to prevent MAME from crashing if a new input device
was connected at runtime. [David Haywood]

Expanded PROFILER_USERx to support up to 8 custom profiler areas.
[Christophe Jaillet]

Added more _NAME macros to be consistent with the standard naming
conventions. [Atari Ace]

Removed old master system code from megaplay.c, megatech.c, segae.c
and updated the drivers to use more recent implementation (from
HazeMD) [David Haywood]

Sped up mario_custom_run() discrete sound. [Derrick Renaud]

Added discrete sound to Sprint 8. [Derrick Renaud]

Removed capacitor aging code and assumed range input is gnd for all 
74LS629. [couriersud]

Omplemented m:n logic for buffered task nodes in discrete sound
[couriersud]
 - preparation work so that a task node output buffer may be read by
    more than one following task.
 - target: implementation of task groups: tasks in a task group run 
    parallel, task groups serial. The current main task may than just 
    be task (in the last task group)

Space Walk - started discrete sounds. [Derrick Renaud]

Added static qualifiers where possible throughout the code. 
[Atari Ace]

Discrete task groups [couriersud]
 - DISCRETE_TASK_START now requires a parameter TASK_GROUP (>=0, <=9)
 - Tasks are scheduled in the order of their task group
 - Nodes are automatically buffered between task groups
 - Discrete core determines nodes which need buffering to minimize 
    overhead (information in DISCRETE_LOG)
 - A discrete block list now must put each stepped node into a task 
    if it uses tasks
 - Drivers not using tasks will get one task allocated automatically
 - Updated drivers accordingly
 - Some more constification

Optimized tab removal in srcclean. [Atari Ace]

Centralized color definitions and made some colors more specific.
[Mamesick]

Hooked up Polynet Warriors joystick properly. [Andrew Gardner]
