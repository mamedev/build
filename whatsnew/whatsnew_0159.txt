-jvs host: fix packet encoding, similar to previous [MetalliC]

-Updates to 315-5881 encryption based on Daytona2 Power Edition's

-Some fixes for multimonitor fullscreen on linux and windows. In
 virtualbox, even switchres now works for two monitors. That doesn't
 imply it will work on real hardware. The probability is higher :-) On
 windows, default render driver now is "opengl" since direct3d wouldn't
 work reliably. This functionality currently is limited to to the
 "-video accel" driver. More userspace blitting enhancements.
