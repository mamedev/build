Moriguchi Hiroko no Quiz de Hyuu!Hyuu! [ywy, 12Me21]

12171: megadriv.xml: Fixed descriptions, added notes [ICEknigh7]
Fixed some descriptions and added some notes.

12180: mr/nl_drlibling.cpp: Fixed the PARATA netlist and optimized performance [aovestdipaperino]
@cuavas 
I finally found a way to have enough perf to emulate the PARATA netlist correctly.
After regenerating the static solvers, this one works quite well.
Possible improvement: put more sounds behind ``OPTIMIZE_FRONTIERS``, I couldn't figure out how to do it.
~With a little bit of effort, this can make the 0.264 release.~
P.S. of course static solvers will need to be regenerated.

12190: megadriv.xml: Added 2 working items, replaced bad dump [ICEknigh7]
Bad Dump replaced with verified one:

12195: rm/rm380z.cpp: Add COS 4.0/F firmware [RobinSergeant]
This PR adds support for COS 4.0/F, new romset attached below:
rm380zf.zip
It's basically the same as COS 4.0/M, but with some differences in the FDC code (no motor control and different timing).  The 8"
  disk support is useful as it allows larger CP/M programs to run using the VDU-80 display.
I have also verified that the 4.0/M roms we had are good, and made the machine descriptions clearer by adding "/M" and "/F"
  postfixes.

12201: util/cdrom, machine/t10mmc: Add preliminary support for multisession CD-ROMs, indexes, and track flags [987123879113]
All of the commits can be reviewed independently. Opening as a draft to get feedback because it's a lot of changes.
I won't be adding CHD support for these features. This is just to get the features somewhat functional within MAME and then in the
  future someone can figure out how to add CHD support. All of the features can be tested by loading a .cue/.bin through `-cdrom`.
- Did some refactoring of util/cdrom for readability since there was a lot of samey code doing the same initializations and checks
  in `parse_metadata` in particular
- Removed `idx0offs` and `idx1offs` in favor of an array of index values and added the code to read indexes from .cues
- Parsed out the `FLAGS` from .cue and made them readable through `get_adr_control`
- Added preliminary multisession support. Multisession support in cues seems to be a bit fragmented so I pulled samples from various
  dumper tools and made notes of the differences
- Filled out the code to return index, sessions, and full TOC for the `T10MMC_CMD_READ_TOC_PMA_ATIP` command
- Implemented `T10MMC_CMD_MECHANISM_STATUS` since it was used by cdrdao, which I was using for testing within MAME to easily check
  if things were reading properly
- Some other small cleanups to t10mmc
Multisession CDs can be tested using the `pumpitup` BIOS machine and manually specifying one of the multisession .cue games. I've
  tested "Pump it Up: The 2nd Dance Floor" and "Pump it Up The O.B.G: The 3rd Dance Floor" and they both are booting and playable
  with these changes. The later games after that are also multisession CD but need additional hardware emulation to boot.
It's possible to run cdrdao within MAME using `shutms11` via a Knoppix live CD (enter `knoppix 2` to boot without the X11 GUI) to do
  more thorough testing. Index detection probably won't work without CDDA scanning implemented, which I didn't include in this PR.
The generated full TOC and legacy TOC were checked against data dumped via Redumper and/or DiscImageCreator when possible. It isn't
  perfect (first lead-in area being hardcoded to 95:00:00 for example) but it mostly generates a matching full TOC and legacy TOC.

12275: heathkit/tlb.cpp: Various file cleanup [mgarlanger]
General cleanup including
- Removed method declarations that were not used/implemented.
- Changed to use u8/u16/u32.
- Add consistent horizontal spacing for readability.
- Removed some duplicate comments.

12282: jaguar.xml: Metadata cleanups [ArcadeShadow]
- Lowercase on descriptive words/abbreviatures ("Demo", "Rev.", "Ver.")
- Moved test result comments to `notes` tag

12283: casio/rz1.cpp: implement individual line outputs [devinacker]
The RZ-1 has ten individual line outs for individual samples in addition to the regular mix output. This lets the individual sounds
  be more easily mixed and panned through the frontend.

12286: atlus/cave.cpp: Added Jumbo Godzilla. [Mikejmoffitt]
New Working Software: Jumbo Godzilla [Toho / Namco]
Jumbo Godzilla runs on hardware nearly identical to Pac-Slot, with the board moniker N-42 EM VIDEO PCB stamped on it.
Notable differences compared to N-44:
* The second OKI is used and has its ROM socket populated
* Instead of a GAL16V8 at U1 controlling the memory map, a simple 74LS138 is installed (albeit socketed).
All ROM names are based directly upon the labels on the ROMs on the PCB. All GALs were found to be locked and thus remain undumped.
I do not have access to an original cabinet, so I can not 100% verify the accuracy of the lamp and motor control outputs. My PCB has
  damage, possibly from overcurrent on one of these controls, so at this time it is not something I can use for further testing.
  Furthermore, I do not have a wiring harness for it, so no clues may be offered there either.
This game has both an operator menu as well as a self-check screen, even though the PCB itself has no DIP switches.

12300: sound/swp00.cpp: Improved DPCM sample decompression [TaleTN]
Through reverse engineering the ROMs of the MU50 and related sound modules I think I've figured out that the magic number that the
  MU50 stores along with the sample format isn't the fractional part of the loop point, but instead holds an offset and scale for
  DPCM decompression (which I guess makes it ADPCM).
I guess some of the related sound devices (like maybe the SWP30?) cloud also use this patch.

12314: galaxian/galaxian.cpp: 'bongoa' dip switches are memory mapped [devinacker]
Compared to the parent set, `bongoa` ignores the AY input ports and reads dip switches from a memory-mapped port.
This set also hacks out the code which initializes the AY port direction bits (compare code at $2288 in both sets), which means the
  'noise enable' bits are never initialized either, leaving the noise generator enabled on all three channels. Is that actually
  what's supposed to happen or should the noise output be disabled by default instead?

This is a followup to https://github.com/mamedev/mame/pull/12314, using this video as a reference. (I haven't attempted to figure
  out which color PROM the board in that video is using, though)
I was inclined to mark this set as a bootleg since the ROM differences are very clearly hacks on top of the parent set, but I'll
  wait for a second opinion on that.

The 10usec delay per bytes is too slow and causing issues with games, so this should bring load speeds back closer to what it was
  with the old code. Should also fix https://mametesters.org/view.php?id=8860.
