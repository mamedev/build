0.8

Program:
- Added some support for Carnival - it boots and runs the demo, but the
  graphics are messed up.

- Fixed graphics in Moon Quasar (yes it does run, but you need the correct
  ROMs)

- Better error checking in the sound initialization routines. It still sucks,
  but at least will notify of problems instead of locking up the emulation.
  The "0. Silence" driver also works.

- Removed the "-nosound" command line switch, replaced it with "-soundcard n"
  which allows to bypass the audio driver selection menu. Use "-soundcard 0"
  to turn off sound.

- Some support for Space Invaders (+ some clones) but it doesn't work well.

- Support for Battle of Atlantis (a Scramble hack)

- The ROM copyright notice is displayed in the main emulation screen.

- Maybe I understood how the character colors are selected in Donkey Kong, at
  least in part, but I'm not sure. Anyway, I started fixing them. I based on
  the Kong emulator by Gary Shepherdson.


  Following changes provided by Mirko Buffoni:

- You can view the game graphics pressing F4. Use cursor keys to change
  graphics set/color, F4 to return to the game.

- Support for Mario Bros. (wrong colors, no sound) and Zaxxon (doesn't work yet).

- Better colors in Amidar and Frogger.

Source:
- Added visible_area to the MachineDriver definition. It was used in all video
  drivers, so it's better to keep it centralized.

- Long-awaited function clearbitmap(), which correctly initializes a bitmap
  using background_pen. Note for people porting MAME to other systems:
  osd_create_bitmap() must call this function, the video drivers rely on that.

- I got rid of machine.c and put all into mame.c... when I have time, I'll try
  to organize the source better.
