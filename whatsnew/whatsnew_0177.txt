  * New option -autostretchxy, to automatically apply -unevenstretchx
     or -unevenstretchy based on source native orientation.

-Warp mode for relative mouse on OSX SDL 2.0.4 (fixes Github issue
 #1232). [bradhugh]

-sengokmj: Inputs refined based on examination of program code: [AJR]
  *  All service inputs are momentary switches, not DIP toggles
  *  Added unused SW2 DIPs as displayed in service mode
  *  Added a couple of obscure inputs not shown in service mode

-pwrkick, othldrby: Various improvements: [AJR]
  * Added NVRAM to Power Kick and Othello Derby; document the reset
     mechanism for the latter
  * Added ticket dispenser to Power Kick (seems to work for the most part)
  * Removed numerous bogus DIP switches
  * Thoroughly reconfigured coin inputs in Power Kick, adding counters
     and lockouts for all three (including the "Key In" input that
     really isn't)
  * More meaningful settings for the "Payout" DIP switch in Power Kick
     (based on program code)

-skylncr.cpp: Improvements to almost all games: [AJR]
  * Use standard input mappings in all games except Sonik Fighter
  * Added working hopper outputs and payout buttons
  * Promoted mbutrfly to WORKING after solving the protection (the code
     wasn't encrypted) and add the button lamps internally associated
     with it
  * Decrypted bdream97, which is almost working now with obvious
     graphical glitches and some apparent input problems

-kurukuru, ppj: Input/output improvements: [AJR]
  * Ticket dispenser now works
  * Corrected "Payout Mode" DIP settings
  * Corrected DSW1 settings in Pyon Pyon Jump
  * Renamed coin inputs and coin-related DIP switches and order by
      increasing denomination
  * Removed "Unknown" inputs that aren't actually used
  * Full character names only for Kuru Kuru Pyon Pyon
  * Reset button now mapped as "Memory Reset"
  * Random notes based on program code

-Show color values in palette viewer: [AJR]
  * Move the mouse over a color rectangle to show index and RGB values
  * For indirect pens, index of the corresponding color is also shown
  * For colors in normal RAM-based palettes, the raw value in memory is
     also shown (does not currently work with most buffered palettes,
     and is incompatible with PROM-based or RAMDAC-based palettes)

-Validity checking improvements: [AJR]
  * Always print the name of each driver with -validate -verbose before
     check to help detect crashes
  * Softlists get validated the first time, not every time but the
     first
  * Make address maps complain when entry bounds lie outside the global
      mask

-Midway V-Unit imrprovements: [Risugami]
 * Added layouts for Cruis'n USA, Cruis'n World, and Off Road Challenge
 * Added wheel force feedback reference and made notes on other outputs
 * Finished implementing the Galil command communication
 * Finished implementing motion controller

-Decrypted River Patrol (Japan), game now working. [MASH]

-Fixed PROMs in Dribbling (dumped a Dribbling PCB with different
 PROMs). [f205v, MASH]

-Added missing PAL dump to Green Beret (bootleg). [MASH]
  * Same PAL dump also in suprmriobl, drhl and ddragon6809a

-Added video proms to Turkey Shoot and Mystic Marathon. [MASH]

-Fixed arcade only build (cshooter.cpp changed to airraid.cpp). [MASH]

-Added proper SMT Flash dumps to deluxe4u. [system11]

-dynax.cpp: dumped color PROMs for Intergirl [f205v]

-arkanoid.cpp: Cleaned up comments; updated notes about which MCUs are
 used. [Lord Nightmare]
