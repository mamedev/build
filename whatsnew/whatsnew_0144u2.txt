Source Changes
--------------
segas32.c: Corrected rom labels and added PCB locations to F1 Super
Lap [The Dumping Union]

Removed ugly functions interrupt_enable_w() and cpu_interrupt_enable()
from the core, and updated all the drivers that used it accordingly.
Full list of drivers changed by this can be found at 
http://mamedev.emulab.it/kale/fast/files/cpu_irq_enable.zip
[Angelo Salese]

Fixed scratchy sound in Birdiy, unlike all other Pac-Man HW games irq
mask is at $5001 instead of $5000, so fixing that fixed the sound as
well [Angelo Salese]

Fixed bogus IRQ/NMI mask bit in Yie Ar Kung-Fu (IRQ mask bit was
masking BOTH lines before) [Angelo Salese]

Fixed bogus irq mask to sound CPU in Syusse Oozumou [Angelo Salese]

BOTH lines before) [Angelo Salese]
