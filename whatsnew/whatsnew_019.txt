[ Sorry to be late, I just taken my graduation in Computer Science and I
  was a little busy.  Here we go! :> ][NdMix]

Program:
- Thanks to Marc LaFontaine that provided me bootleg version we have now
  support for Popeye.  It's not yet playable (when the game starts the
  machine resets) but it has music already.  It's also very slow, since
  it uses a 512x480 screen.  I'm looking for decryption scheme for original
  Popeye board using Lionel's idea [pain!].

- Fabrice Frences fixed the Qbert driver and added support for Reactor.

- Jarek Burczynski provided a preliminar but playable driver for Arabian.
  Colors are wrong, but it support sound already.

- Mike Coates fixed the Space Panic background colors.  Also added hiscore
  support.

- Nicola Salmoria found how Elevator Action background works.  Also updated
  all drivers that have a scrolling background.  Support for the bootleg
  version of Elevator Action ("elevatob"). The original version doesn't
  work because of copy protection.  The graphics are almost OK now,
  albeit quite slow.

- Paul Leaman (author of the 1942 emulator) provided exhaustive information
  on (guess what) 1942, which is now supported.

- Some changes to music tempo of Frogger

- Added partial sound support to RallyX (no explosions yet). Thankx to Ron
  Fries.

- Added preliminar unplayable WarpWarp.  Graphic is ok, but the game hangs
  during diagnostic.

- Changed noise_lenght and noise_rate values in Moon Cresta audio driver,
  so now noise is much more noisier!

- Shaun Stephenson provided me original Phoenix sound samples, so I adjusted
  sound driver to achieve correct sound modulation and frequency, and
  substituted noise generator for shots and explosions with a couple of
  samples.  Noise generator can be still used (just don't put the samples
  in the directory) with Phoenix and it's used in Pleiads.  I changed
  white noise waveshape and adjusted frequency, so now it sounds better.

Source:
- Added input ports 5 and 6 in CPUINTRF module.

- Fixes to setdipswitches() and the fps counter in COMMON.C, to make them
  work correctly with non 8x8 fonts.

- Substituted strcmp() with case insensitive stricmp() in MAME.C and MSDOS.C.
  This solve the problem with upcase gamename (ex: Win95 and NDOS).

- Added copyscrollbitmap() to COMMON.C, that semplifies programming for
  those games that use scroll.
