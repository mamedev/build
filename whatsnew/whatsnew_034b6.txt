0.34 BETA 6

Note about the x86 asm 68000 core: several bugs have been fixed (most notably,
it now runs under pure DOS) but it is still not complete. For example, the two
Metal Slugs hang shortly after game start. They will work if you recompile
using the C core.

These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Accurate colors in Jungler. Also fixed char flipping and sprite alignment.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Improved Vastar. [Roberto Ventura]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- Sound in Super Space Invaders. [Ernesto Corvi]

- Added decay to Donkey Kong. [Andrew Scott]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] Replaced the -fm option with -ym2203opl. Added -noym3812opl to use the
  digital emulation of the YM3812 instead of the SoundBlaster OPL chip. Note
  that with -noym3812opl you also need external drum samples. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Clone sets are not reported as missing by -verifyroms if only the parent set
  is present. [John Butler]


Source:
-------

- [DOS] Now using version 1.05 of the SEAL audio library. This should fix
  problems with the ENSONIQ AudioPCI and Creative PCI64 cards.

- YM2610 emulator. This is used by the NeoGeo games. [Hiromitsu Shioya]

- TMS9900 emulator. [Andy Jones, based on original code by Ton Brouwer]


NeoGeo Support
--------------

This beta contains some major improvements to the neogeo emulation.  Work on
this driver also uncovered several bad rom dumps, most of which you can correct
yourself, existing bad rom dumps should still work but will give checksum and/or
rom length errors on startup.

How to:

You need a zip file called neogeo.zip in your rompath.  It should contain at
least three files:

neo-geo.rom (128k)
ng-sfix.rom (128k)
ng-sm1.rom (128k)

The rom 'ng-sm1.rom' is badly dumped in many archives, you will need one that is
128k, see later for full details on bad roms.  Using a 256k rom will still work
but will give a length & checksum error on every game.

Important!  The bios zip file must be called neogeo.zip NOT neo-geo.zip, ie,
there should be no dash in the middle.

You also need to place the game zip in your rompath.  If you do not know what 8
character filename the NeoGeo game you want to play has you can type:

mame -listclones neogeo

That will list the 8 character zip names of all currently supported games.

What's New?
-----------

* FULL sound support, FM synth and ADPCM samples, on 90% of games using the
YM2610 emulator.  The games without working sound should be fixed soon.

- Optional rom loading of samples:  You may find games that worked before will
not work now due to lack of memory as all the sound roms need to be loaded.
Some games will require an extra 16 megabytes of memory to load the sound roms.
You can force Mame NOT to load these samples if you specify no sound BEFORE rom
loading takes place.  In Dos this means you must type:

mame game -soundcard 0

If you DO NOT specify soundcard 0 then all sound roms will be loaded and you may
experience memory problems.

* Improved graphics:

- Auto-animations are supported, these are used in many games.  The Neogeo
graphics hardware can cause animation without intervention from the main cpu.
You can see this in the backgrounds of games such as Karnov's Revenge, Street
Hoops, Samurai Shodown, King Of Fighters, etc.

- Very accurate scaling support, including full screen zooms.

- No more 'missing tiles' on zoomed graphics.

- MAJOR speedup!  You should see at least 20-50% increase on all games.  The downside is
you will see a black screen for a few seconds at the start of every game as
the graphics are converted to a custom format.  There are many other
optimisations in the video code too.

- Fixed bug in y-flipped tiles glitched when y<0 (Thrash Rally)

* All games for which rom dumps are available are now supported.  99% of them
are working.

* Several games have experimental 68000 idle cycle skipping, for these games you
should see increases of between 5% and 20%.  Games currently using this method
are:
	Puzzle De Pon
	Karnov's Revenge
	Wind Jammers
	Street Hoops
	Neo Bomberman

* SRAM save size has been reduced to 0x2000 bytes from 0x10000.  The NeoGeo
has 8 memory frames and will store sram data for upto 8 games regardless
of how many physical cartridges the machine can take.  The Mame emulation
emulates a fixed 1 cartridge neogeo, therefore only the first 0x2000
bytes of the SRAM should ever be used.  Due to bullet-proofed(!) memory
handling there should be no more corrupt sram saves either.  Remember you can
delete a game settings by deleting it's file in the 'hi' directory.

Bug where SRAM states were reloaded upon every reset is fixed.

Known Problems/To Do:
---------------------

Some games will give a piracy warning.  You can still play the games if you
set them to run in Console (Home) mode.  For some games you can set the game
back to arcade mode after the protection check is done and leave it that
way (because some games leave a flag in SRAM as to whether the game has passed
it's security check).

Line (row) scrolling is not implemented.  This is used for the floor in
Karnov's Revenge, special effects in Spinmasters, etc, and many others.

The calendar chip is not yet implemented.

This release should give a substantial speed boost over previous betas, and there
are some more optimisation ideas to be tried.

Bad Roms
--------

Several bad rom dumps have been found, this is where a rom has corrupt data
and may also be the wrong size.  'Fixed' rom dumps will become available from
the usual places in time.  The most common error is that a rom is twice the
size it should be, and that the second half is either the same as the first or
just has junk in it.  To be fix these roms you simply split them in half, and
throw away the second half.  You should do a binary split, meaning your split
program should not save any formatting information to the file.  As mentioned
above bad rom dumps will continue to work but will give checkums and length
errors.

The Neorage team will support all fixes to the bad roms and make sure their
emulator is compatible.  Most fixed romsets will work on Neorage already.
