6825: Docs updates [Firehawke]
This is a re-try on #6006 for @cuavas, which was screwed up when I updated the branch not remembering it was for the joystick
  mapping update. Combination of exhaustion and migraine.
See notes from December 2019 for current status on that.
Also added a draft health warning, probably something that should have been in MAME ages ago. A recent play of Salamander reminded
  me that some of the older machines were designed long before anyone took epilepsy into account.

Added newly dumped roms from exidy PCB, images now match fixed images from dmodrbcc (expected)
Added new skeleton driver in exidyttl.cpp.
    (Redundant with dmodrbcc in chicago.cpp, but it is a different PCB layout and different company)

6864: Add arm64 and s390x to travis CI [belegdol]
The fact that asmjit does not build on anything except x86 got missed recently. This commit adds arm64 and s390x to travis CI so
  that issues like this get noticed sooner.

6893: hp_ipc: added beeper [fulivi]

  the dozen or so possible.

6894: 6821pia: guard against side effects when these should be disabled [68bit]
Was not sure if all the log messages should be inhibited when the debugger reads the device, so did not touch some of those.

6895: rs232 serial printer: initialize the data output high. [68bit]
High is the restful state for RS232. The low level could cause
continual breaks to be received by an attached device and this could
cause problems for some drives.

6896: os9 dsk: add 8 inch, 16 sector, single density formats [68bit]
These formats were by OS9 L1 on the Motorola EXORciser.

6897: MDOS disk format support [68bit]
Motorola DOS, used on the EXORciser etc. The single sided format has been tested.

6898: wd177x dsk: be permissive of some missing sectors in later tracks [68bit]
A single missing sector was causing it to give up on an images, as incompatible. Being a little more permissive here helps working
with some old recovered disk images with some lost sectors.
It had once looked at only the first track to assess compatibility, but that was changed to look at all tracks to deal with
  variations on the first track and variations on different sides, but that was probably a little to restrictive.

6905: sgi_mips: new software list additions [davide125]

6906: Add Monkey King 3B SoC skeleton and RS-70 system [daveshah1]
The Monkey King 3B is an emulation-oriented ARM-based SoC by Digital Media Cartridge, a company closely associated with AtGames. The
  Monkey King family is a successor to their Titan ARM-based SoCs.
The RS-70 is one of the systems using it, with 648 NES and Genesis games on NOR flash in a PS1-esque casing and HDMI output.
This is just the beginnings of the core, all it does so far is print the following debug messages before hanging, but at least that
  means the memory mapping is vaguely right:
```

6908: mdos dsk: fix the cells size and gaps, make clear its Motorola MDOS [68bit]
Some more scrutiny made it clear that the cells size was wrong, and the gaps then needed some correction too. It was working, the
  PLL adjusted the bit clock, but it was off. Updated the comments to make it clear that this is the Motorola MDOS format, as
  requested. FYI EXORterm 155 and EXORciser emulators are being developed and reading, writing and formatting this disc format is
  working - trying to finish them off and clean them up.

------------------
Robotron: 2084 (Unidesa license) [Juan Romero, ClawGrip]

6927: EXORterm 155: Motorola terminal [68bit]
This was an early Motorola terminal that was used with Motorola MDOS on the EXORciser. I doubt it is of general utility except for
  MDOS so it has not been added to the default RS232 device. It has been implement as a device so that it can be integrated with an
  EXORciser emulator, but a stand alone front end is also included. It has been tested on an EXORciser emulator.
The firmware was from http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/components/motorola/6800/EXORterm_155/ and there is a useful manual there
  too. There appears to be no dump of the character ROM, so an apparently similar published Motorola character set has been
  substituted for now. The collection of files is at https://68bit.org/exorterm155_device.zip

6930: allow v4strike and v4barqst to decode questions and fix some clone relationships [DavidHaywood]

6931: mc6852 - implement more functionality, add byte interface. [68bit]
This adds functionality needed to support a Motorola m68sfdc floppy disk controller emulator. It adds byte sized functions for
  sending and receiving data as these are a practical size for the FDC emulation. It should not regress any existing functionality
  and does not touch the serial interface which appears to be only a skeleton. Various issues TODO are noted. It has been tested on
  a m68sfdc emulator running EXORciser firmware.

6949: Update RTD docs theme to 0.5.0 to fix search box. [Firehawke]
It appears that the RTD theme hadn't been updated in at least four years. This is likely the reason search broke.

6950: exorterm: more realistic layout screen aspect ratio. [68bit]
This change adjusts the aspect ratio to bring it close to that in the
photo of the screen in the manual. The monitor has a 4:3 aspect
ratio. The character area resolution is 720x288 pixels and the prior
1:1 dot ratio was far from realistic.

6957: M6800 EXORciser [68bit]
The ROMs are available on the web and are packaged at: https://68bit.org/exorciser.zip
Some sources:
ftp://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/bits/Motorola/Exorcisor/
http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/components/motorola/6800/exorciser/
https://github.com/jhallen/exorsim
For a web based example of this MAME emulator running MDOS see https://68bit.org/mame/exorciser.html which should boot into MDOS,
  and to test the screen editor type "E NEWS.SA". There are a range of disks available for this some of the above links including a
  FORTRAN, COBOL, BASIC, PASCAL, and MPL. Most disks are in IMD format and this seems to work ok in MAME thanks to recent
  improvements.
The disk controller ROM seems dated and does not support double sided disks or four drives. Have not found EXBUG 2 needed for an
  EXORciser II, or any of the 6809 ROMs apart from OS9 ROMs.

6958: mw8080bw: multiple improvements to gunfight netlist audio [colinhowell]
Model for transistors adjusted, replacing default NPN transistor
model with a high-gain NPN transistor type that more closely
resembles those used by the real Gun Fight sound circuits. This
has a quite obvious effect on the shot sounds, and it seems the
circuits were designed for this effect.
Made all volume potentiometers user-adjustable; previously fixed
at 50%.
Replaced abstract model of noise generator with component-level
one, including a model of the generator's zener diode. Zener
noise is provided by an associated Gaussian white noise source
running off a 48 kHz clock. Both the zener diode and Gaussian
white noise source are component models recently added to the
netlist library.
Supply voltage to amplifying transistors tweaked downward from
16.5 volts to 16 volts, determined by properly analyzing power
supply circuit and confirmed with a documented reference.
Much more commentary describing the sound circuits' function and
modeling issues.

- Start to untangle and split apart and properly identify some mpu4vid sets now that they boot.  There's nothing actually new here,
  despite it appearing that there are a lot of new clones and new sets, they're just the result of finally being able to identify
  some things properly, work out what belongs where, and gain a better understand of what is missing - some things were in entirely
  the wrong drivers, or paired with the incorrect ROMs. [David Haywood]

6984: mw8080bw: improvements to 280zzzap netlist audio [colinhowell]
Noise-based sound effects corrected. The original strength of the
zener noise voltage was about three orders of magnitude too low
for the current being passed through a zener of this type. This
prevented the noise generator from working as designed and made
the noise far too weak for the noise-based sound effects to work
properly. Those effects now sound much closer to the real hardware.
Implemented faster high-level emulation version of noise generator.
(Credit to couriersud for suggesting this.) The corrected noise
voltage made the component-level emulation of the noise generator
much too demanding on the minimum timestep needed to produce
accurate results without unrealistic voltage spikes, and so will
not run accurately at reasonable emulation speeds. But by replacing
it with a simple but effective AFUNC()-based comparator, we get a
functionally similar noise signal generator that produces
effectively identical output while still being able to run with
48 kHz static timestepping. So we get both decent emulation speed
and correct-sounding noise effects.
Added output voltage clipping on post-crash sound to remove
voltage spikes, resulting in a smoother, more accurate sound.
(Credit to Aaron Giles for suggesting this clipping method.)
Changed output to be taken from second LM3900 output opamp
(inverted signal) for smoother waveform and better tone quality.
Added master volume potentiometer which can be user-set, set to
midpoint by default. Adjusted output scaling and offset to match.
Various explanatory comments expanded or corrected.

6986: replace tkmag220 ROM with correct dump [Team Europe] [DavidHaywood]

6987: Switch appveyor GCC build to -O3 (issue #6804) [belegdol]
GCC build on windows appears to be broken on optimisation levels below -O3. O3 build has finished within approximately 50 minutes
  which means that it at least has a chance of succeeding. Once gcc or mame is fixed to build with -O1, this change can be reverted.
  While not ideal, it would unbreak the CI until a proper fix is in place.

6988: Overhaul travis.yml in an attempt to speed up macos builds [belegdol]
macOS builds have recently begun failing due to hitting 50 minute time limit. This change appears to shave a couple minutes off,
  enough to make the cutoff:

-Slotified Mac 128k/512k/512ke/Plus keyboard port. [Vas Crabb]
 * Available keyboards are us (M0110, U.S.), gb (M0110B, British), fr (M0110F, French), pad (M0120F, numeric keypad with passthrough
    port) and plus (M0110A, U.S. with integrated numeric keypad).  The mac128k, mac512k and mac512ke drivers default to the numeric
    keypad with the U.S. keyboard connected to the passthrough port; the macplus driver defaults to the U.S. keyboard with
    integrated numeric keypad.
 * Note that the numeric keypad may seem strange.  Four of the operators work as cursor arrows if you don't hold shift.  There is a
    comma on one of the keys, but by the time System 6 was released, Apple had decided an equals sign was more useful, so that's
    what it will produces on newer system versions.  The U.S. keyboard with integrated numeric keypad emulates these aspects of the
    stand-alone keypad - pressing the operator keys on the keypad sends fake shit key down/up events, and using the arrow keys while
    holding shift will produces operator characters rather than selecting text.
 * The ISO layout keyboards (M0110B and M0110F) produce different scan codes to the ANSI keyboards (M0110 and M0110A) but they don't
    report a different identification byte.  To use an ISO keyboard, you must open the Keyboard control panel and change the layout
    to International (and change it back to Domestic if you switch back to an ANSI keyboard).

This doesn't actually work at the moment due to issues with 6522 VIA emulation, but it will work with macplus sys603 if applied on
  top of revision 963a2c166d080e78e6de7fe432ed7944c59a6083.

 * Added unit tests for plib::pfunction.

-netlist: remove soft reset support. [couriersud]
 * Electronic circuits and base components like resistors or capacitors do not have a reset line. You can use them to create reset
    circuits. There is thus no point to support soft reset, the equivalent to pressing the reset button.
 * Fixed some bugs around reset and start up logic.
 * This also fixes the "scramble F3" crash.

   - No skipping red warnings.
   - A key-value map of device shortnames and yellow warnings must be stored in the .cfg file, along with a timestamp of the last
      time the system was run and the last time a warning was shown.
   - On starting a system, the map of device shortnames and yellow warnings must be built and compared to the one loaded from the
      .cfg file.  If it doesn't match, if the system hasn't been started in seven days, or a yellow warning hasn't been shown in 14
      days, the warning is not to be skipped.

-ibm21s850: Added a skeleton device for the iBM 21S850 IEEE 1394 PHY controller. [Ryan Holtz]

-netlist: improve dealing with non-convergence situations. [couriersud]
 * No changes for well-behaved netlists.
 * Netlists reporting "newton loops exceeded" messages should now report a lot less of these messages.
 * In case newton-raphson does not converge, netlist will reset the state back to the beginning of the timestep. It will than use a
    number of very small timesteps to hopefully deal with the non-convergence due to a too big timesteps. Afterwards solving
    continues using dynamic timestepping until the time-slice is complete.
 * This is a lot better than the previous approach.
 * This is meant as a performance optimization helper. Ideally, your netlists never produce "newton loops exceeded" messages.
 * Any events for connected analog and digital inputs will happen after the timeslice is complete. Thus this approach - as the
    previous one - are not suited for high-frequency (such as video outputs) situations. In these case, only dynamic timestepping or
    reducing the fixed timestep are a suitable solution.

-netlist: use threads on netlist logs. [couriersud]
 * This significantly increases the performance of output/terminal logs.
 * Adds a psemaphore class to pmulti_threading.h.

-netlist: fix 74121 clocking logic. [Aaron Giles]

-netlist: fix power pin names for CMOS devices. [couriersud]
 * For truthtable cmos devices the power pin names will now be set according to the logic family.
 * Fix some issues for CD4538
 * Change "already connected" warning to info level. Some ICs (CD4538) connect pins internally to GND and the schematics again
    externally. This will cause this info to be printed. The warning now is a lot more verbose.

-netlist: first batch of explicit handlers. [couriersud]
 * Currently devices use the "update" function if no handler is given for an input.
 * For this to work the update function has to be virtual. This will cause issues on shared execution schemes like CPU/GPU using
    nvcc.
 * This is the first batch of changes to ensure that handler resolution is static.

-netlist: emit a warning every 100 invocations of nr resolution. [couriersud]

-vsmile_ctrl: Disable verbose logging (nw) [Ryan Holtz]

-mccpm: added fdc, bankdev, notes [Robbbert]

-exorterm: more realistic layout screen aspect ratio. [68bit]
 * This change adjusts the aspect ratio to bring it close to that in the photo of the screen in the manual. The monitor has a 4:3
    aspect ratio. The character area resolution is 720x288 pixels and the prior 1:1 dot ratio was far from realistic.

-netlist: next batch of explicit handlers. [couriersud]

-netlist: another batch of explicit handler refactoring. [couriersud]

-ibm21s850, tsb12lv01a: Assorted fixes, nw. The Grid no longer hangs. [Ryan Holtz]

-mw8080bw: multiple improvements to gunfight netlist audio [Colin Douglas Howell]
 * Model for transistors adjusted, replacing default NPN transistor model with a high-gain NPN transistor type that more closely
    resembles those used by the real Gun Fight sound circuits. This has a quite obvious effect on the shot sounds, and it seems the
    circuits were designed for this effect.
 * Made all volume potentiometers user-adjustable; previously fixed at 50%.
 * Replaced abstract model of noise generator with component-level one, including a model of the generator's zener diode. Zener
    noise is provided by an associated Gaussian white noise source running off a 48 kHz clock. Both the zener diode and Gaussian
    white noise source are component models recently added to the netlist library.
 * Supply voltage to amplifying transistors tweaked downward from 16.5 volts to 16 volts, determined by properly analyzing power
    supply circuit and confirmed with a documented reference.
 * Much more commentary describing the sound circuits' function and modeling issues.

-mw8080bw: improvements to 280zzzap netlist audio (#6984) [Colin Douglas Howell]
 * mw8080bw: improvements to 280zzzap netlist audio
   - Noise-based sound effects corrected. The original strength of the zener noise voltage was about three orders of magnitude too
      low for the current being passed through a zener of this type. This prevented the noise generator from working as designed and
      made the noise far too weak for the noise-based sound effects to work properly. Those effects now sound much closer to the
      real hardware.
   - Implemented faster high-level emulation version of noise generator. (Credit to couriersud for suggesting this.) The corrected
      noise voltage made the component-level emulation of the noise generator much too demanding on the minimum timestep needed to
      produce accurate results without unrealistic voltage spikes, and so will not run accurately at reasonable emulation speeds.
      But by replacing it with a simple but effective AFUNC()-based comparator, we get a functionally similar noise signal generator
      that produces effectively identical output while still being able to run with 48 kHz static timestepping. So we get both
      decent emulation speed and correct-sounding noise effects.
   - Added output voltage clipping on post-crash sound to remove voltage spikes, resulting in a smoother, more accurate sound.
      (Credit to Aaron Giles for suggesting this clipping method.)
   - Changed output to be taken from second LM3900 output opamp (inverted signal) for smoother waveform and better tone quality.
   - Added master volume potentiometer which can be user-set, set to midpoint by default. Adjusted output scaling and offset to
      match.
   - Various explanatory comments expanded or corrected.

 * Added const delegates.
 * Added subsolver stats
 * Removed dead code.

-netlist: separate nl_base.h into separate header files. [couriersud]
 * This clean-up exercise will hopefully make it easier to navigate the core code. Another long term goal is to further straighten
    the object model.

-netlist: Fix clang unused variable warning. [couriersud]

-netlist: Fix format string in gcr code. [couriersud]

-netlist: include GMRES solver in build. [couriersud]
 * The GMRES solver for larger matrices (>>100) can outperform Gaussian elimination. Including it so it gets wider attention.
 * As far as I know netlist is the only SPICE-like circuit simulation providing a GMRES solver.

-netlist: document better GMRES options. [couriersud]

-netlist: Fix scheduling bug. [couriersud]

-netlist: sub solvers now have their own parameter set. [couriersud]
 * Example: PARAM(Solver.Solver_0.METHOD, "GMRES")
 * Will use the GMRES solver instead of the default MAT_CR solver.
 * Same applies to all Solver parameters.
 * Please use with care. If you change your netlist (e.g. using frontiers) the allocation of nets to solvers and the number of
    solvers may change. Thus this type of tweaking should only be used after the netlist completely works.
