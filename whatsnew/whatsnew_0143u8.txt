Added tables from vlm5030 as verified by decap from ogoun. Adapted
vlm5030 to use the tms5xxx common tables file. Some details have yet
to be worked out for certain (how exactly the reflection coefficients
beyond k=2 address the k2+ rom)
[ogoun, Lord Nightmare, The Dumping Union]

Adjusted the VLM5030 K3 thru K10 coefficients to be based not on
reading the K2 rom but based on the index itself <<6 or 7. This makes
the games sound much better and explains the very small ram size used
for coefficients other than K1 and K2. This needs further
investigation and figuring out of the die schematic to settle
completely. [Lord Nightmare]
