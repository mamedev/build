11608: util/ioprocs.cpp: Add wrappers for common patterns [cuavas]
First, some background on this.  POSIX-like read/write operations have somewhat complicated semantics.  In particular, they can
  return short for multiple reasons:
* If a read or write call is interrupted by an asynchronous signal before completing, it will return short.  If no data has been
  read/written it will set `EINTR`, otherwise it will return success.
* If a read or write to a non-blocking descriptor would block, it will return short.  If no data has been read/written, it will set
  `EAGAIN` or `EWOULDBLOCK`, otherwise it will return success.
* If some characteristic of the underlying device  would prevent a read/write of the requested size from appearing to be atomic with
  respect to other read/write calls, it will return short.
* A read will return short if the end of the stream is reached.  However the application must attempt to complete the read to
  distinguish between a read that failed to complete for some other reason (e.g. `EAGAIN`) and actually reaching the end of the
  stream.
* If a write partially completes before encountering an error, it will return short.  To obtain the actual error, you must attempt
  to complete the write, which means the error is not obtained atomically.  This can lead to results that are not intuitive.  For
  example, if a write partially completes because the device runs out of free space, but more space is freed before the application
  attempts to complete the write, the application will see the write complete (albeit not atomically with respect to other
  read/write calls), never seeing the `ENOSPC` or `EDQUOT` error.
Reading/writing zero bytes may cause error checking to be performed, so it may fail in some cases.  As such, attempting to
  read/write zero bytes should not be simply ignored.
This adds `try_read`/`try_read_at` and `try_write`/`try_write_at` wrappers to encapsulate the process of attempting to complete a
  read or write for cases where one doesn’t care whether the operation is atomic with respect to other reads/writes.
The functions return pairs or tuples so they can be used with structured binding declarations and `std::tie` when convenient.
  They’re declared as free functions to keep the interfaces pure.  They can be called using unqualified names due to
  argument-dependent name lookup.
There are variants of `try_read` and `try_read_at` that allocate space for the output.  Note that they will always allocate the
  requested number of bytes even though fewer bytes may actually be read.  One limitation of the allocating variants is that they
  won’t work if you try to read zero bytes for the purpose of checking for errors – the non-allocating variants must be used for
  this purpose (or you can call `read` directly on the stream).
I’m not convinced `try_read` and `try_write` are necessarily the best names for these.  If someone can come up with unambiguously
  better names, I’d be happy to change them.
Like #11588, this also removes some `device_image_interface` member functions in favour of working with the image file object
  directly.
I haven’t ported much code across to use these functions, since the names may need to change.

11997: heath/h17_fdc.cpp: Skeleton impl for the H-88-1 Hard-Sectored Controller [mgarlanger]
Initial code for the Heath H-88-1 Hard-sectored controller for the H-89 family of systems. This supported up to 3 floppy drives. 
This initial code implements the I/O ports of the controller, includes the AMI S2350 USRT, the transmitter clock for the USRT. 
Things still needed
- MAME's core code must support hard-sectored disk images.
- Receiver clock for the USRT, based on read clock bits from the disk.
- Add support for a Heath hard-sectored disk image format.
- Add controller to the H89 systems.

12003: apple/apple2e.cpp: Correctly reset IOU softswitches on system reset [xotmatrix]
Some IOU softswitches are not being reset when the system is reset. This can leave the display and annunciators in an incorrect
  state after a reset.
From a fresh start, enter the following into the monitor to enable 80-column video and then press RESET. Note the 80-column video
  remains enabled which is not correct.
```
*C00D:1
```
From a fresh start, enter the following into the monitor to draw MouseText characters to the screen and then press RESET. Note the
  MouseText characters remain enabled which is not correct.
```
*C00F:1 N 428:40 41 42 43 44 45
```
This patch corrects these issues by adding reset handling for the missing IOU softswitches:
- 80COL
- ALTCHR
- AN0
- AN1
- AN2
- AN3
In addition, reset code related to MMU, IOU, and LC softswitches has been reorganized into logical groups.

12039: New NMK214 device: added implementation for NMK214 descrambling GFX device and hook it up to nmk16 driver [sergiopolog]
Added implementation for NMK214 as a new device. It's used for descrambling GFX data on some games in the nmk16 driver.
The implementation was made based on the reverse engineering work of the chip at silicon level: 
https://github.com/sergiopolog/GateArray-RE/tree/master/NMK/nmk-214
Results of the descrambling GFX process for both sprites and background tiles using this implementation match exactly with the ones
  from previous implementation made by @mamehaze (and Antiriad) back then.
In this case, all the internal configurations that could be selected to perform it are included, even if they are never used for any
  game, just for documentation purposes.
Real hardware performs the descrambling process on the fly for each word/byte fetch from GFX ROMs, but due how the drawgfx system is
  made on MAME, I couldn't find an option to integrate it and mimic the real hw behaviour.
I simply run the decoding of the entire GFX regions just when both devices are initialized at startup, (similar to what the previous
  implementation did on init handler).
If there is a way to do this on real GFX fetches from 'sprites' and 'bgtiles' regions, please, let me know.
By now, the descrambling process is only hooked up for sabotenb (and clones) set.
On a later PR, I plan to apply it to the rest of games using it on nmk16 driver and split the current "tdragon_prot_state" class
  into two different classes: One for NMK111 and NMK113 protection (tdragon and hachamf) and another one for NMK214-215 protection,
  as they are completely different processes, even if they use the same MCU model (TLCS-90)

12044: rm/rm380z.cpp: Add support for high resolution graphics, colour and text character dimming [RobinSergeant]
This PR adds supports for the HRG board described here:
https://vt100.net/rm/docs/380z-hrg.pdf
It was needed to run most educational software so would be nice to get this in.  As I had to change the palette I've also added the
  missing dimmed text attribute, and a config port to choose between a colour or monochrome monitor.
Support for both the High Resolution mode (320x192, 4 colour) and Medium Resolution (160x96, 16 colour) is included.  The two modes
  share video ram, and the medium mode includes two separate display pages (one page is stored at odd addresses, and the other at
  even addresses).  Each logical colour index maps to one of a possible 256 different colours, which was quite impressive for the
  time - much more colourful than many 8-bit home computers!
The HRG occupies the first 20 lines of the display, with the lower 4 lines reserved for text.  Although it is also possible to draw
  text over the graphics area (when the VDU is not set to graphics mode).
It is best demonstrated by using RM Basic where you can now easily draw colourful graphics like this:

12054: emu/save.cpp: Make illegal save state registrations always fatal [cuavas]
The only thing that causes non-fatal illegal save state registrations right now is registering an item for save states after start
  in a system not marked as supporting save states.
It’s high time anything doing that gets fixed.  Not supporting save states means save state support is incomplete, not that the
  driver has a license to do illegal things.
Opening this as a pull request to give fair warning, and so it can be merged after freeze.

12058: osd/osdnet.cpp: Removed dependency from OSD network device to libemu [cuavas]
This is required for #12054 to avoid fatal errors with network devices.  This doesn’t completely clean up the interface to OSD
  network modules (it’s still using free functions and static variables in a really nasty way), but it does clean up a very nasty
  cross dependency.
There are still issues with the receive polling timer:
* The interval is set based on the MTU, assuming the rate packets arrive is no more than the theoretical maximum rate that maximal
  length packets can be serialised.  However, smaller packets can arrive much faster, particularly when using jumbo frames (9000
  octet MTU).
* That aside, the code was always based on the incorrect assumption that an `emu_timer` will synchronise with real time.  It
  doesn’t, so for a system that’s fairly lightweight to emulate (e.g. an Apple II with a Uthernet card), it polls furiously while
  running the emulation for a frame, then doesn’t poll at all for the majority of the time while it waits for the real world to
  catch up before updating video and starting the next frame.
* It probably needs a postload handler to deal with the fact that changing the host network interface isn’t something that can be
  included in save states.
I realise this wreaks havoc with the macOS netdev PR.  I haven’t forgotten.  I’ll update that PR to deal with this myself.

Add a small section talking about the ``EMULATOR=0`` build option.

12067: gdbstub fixes for Windows and m68000 [BartmanAbyss]
- `debug_gdbstub::generate_target_xml()` contained newlines that were converted from '\n' to '\r\n' on Windows, thus breaking the
  gdb packet checksum (`debug_gdbstub::send_reply`), so removed newlines in `escape_packet`. GDB doesn't care about newlines in XML
  files. This seemed to be the least invasive fix I could think of.
- m68000: complained about not finding registers  `A7` => `SP`, `PC` => `CURPC`
I guess we should rename other instances of `PC` to `CURPC` as well, as `device_state_entry::device_state_entry()` automatically
  changes the name of PC to `CURPC` (see distate.cpp line 66)

12074: Use literal romaji for Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu game titles [cuavas]
Looking to solicit opinions on this.
The 実況パワフルプロ野球 franchise is usually called “Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu” in English.  However, in Japanese media, it seems to be
  more frequently rendered in literal romaji as “JIKKYOU PAWAFURU PURO YAKŪ”.  You can see this in the attract sequences for the
  games on Konami System 573, for example (e.g. `powyakex`).
“Powerful” and “Pro” are definitely loanwords from English.  The MAME convention has always been to use standard English spellings
  for loanwords.  Also, if we switch to literal romaji, we’ll be the odd ones out as all the other software catalogues will still be
  using “Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu”.
So in this case, should “JIKKYOU PAWAFURU PURO YAKŪ” be treated as an official Latin script title and used for system and software
  descriptions?  Or should it be treated as a pronunciation guide so we keep the conventional spellings of the loanwords?

12087: util/cdrom: Refactor parse_cue and parse_gdicue [987123879113]
Closes https://github.com/mamedev/mame/issues/12081. Follow up to https://github.com/mamedev/mame/pull/11913.
After fixing the problem mentioned in the issue (the first commit) I realized there isn't that much unique code between
  `parse_gdicue` and `parse_cue` so I decided to merge them into one function so that there's no need to maintain two separate .cue
  parsers anymore.
Additionally I did some other small cleanups such as clearing out some of the line buffers and adding some additional error checks
  in. Sufficient size checks were already in place already so it wasn't likely to crash anything but I figured it didn't hurt while
  I'm at changing things around. Mainly was concerned that it looks like you could end up copying a bunch of garbage into `token` if
  `linebuffer` had garbage in it when `cdrom_file::tokenize` was called.
For testing I extracted some v5 CHDs I had on hand and then recreated them to make sure the hashes matched. Also tried a few Redump
  Dreamcast dumps to make sure the extracted .bin matched the original Redump data (compared with all individual tracks combined
  into a single file so I could just do a SHA1 check between the CHD dump and original data).

12099: cpu/hcd62121: Implement missing mov instructions and timer wait [qufb]
These changes bring emulation closer to the intended speed, allowing screens in CFX9850 models to be interacted without the system
  turning off immediately (instead of the intended 6 minutes of idle time).
George Stagg identified some missing instructions and how timers were set. In particular, that instruction 0xB3 sets the timeout for
  the next sleep operation at instruction 0xFE.
Concrete values for timeouts are based on test ROMs I wrote to iterate over almost all possible parameters, using a logic analyzer
  to get approximate durations for each timeout. If anyone is interested in checking out these timings, you can open these traces in
  DSView, using the sigrok decoder found on the same repo.

12124: debugger: add nul-terminated string output to printf/logerror [pmackinlay]
* support lower-case hexadecimal output
* remove some format handling code obsoleted by strformat.h
This proposed change extends the debugger `printf`/`logerror` commands with a `%s` format specifier, allowing nul-terminated strings
  to be output from emulated system memory. I've found this incredibly handy for debugging Unix system calls like `open()` and
  `execve()`, and combined with exception points, allow this kind of tracing purely from the debugger instead of adding system
  dependent compile-time enabled debug code in the CPU.
As an example of usage, for my current ns32k system target, I'm using debugger commands like this: `eps 5,w@(pc+1)==0x003b,{
  logerror "0x%08x: execve(%s)\n", PC, :cpu, d@(r0); g; }`. That is, when exception 5 ("supervisor call instruction") is triggered
  with system call number 0x3b, grab the first parameter from a `dword` in memory pointed at by register 0, and dump it as a
  nul-terminated string from the specified device address space.
Other than possibly adding a precision specifier to limit the maximum output length to minimize the impact of user error or
  unexpected data, I'm interested to hear any comments on this addition or its implementation.

12128: rm/rm380z.cpp: Use sn74s262 as the VDU-40 COS 3.4 character generator [RobinSergeant]
This PR uses the sn74s262 device, to replace the old fake character ROM, for VDU-40 character generation.
As a dump of the sn74s262 ROM does not seem to exist I have re-created it by hand from the datasheet:
http://www.datasheetarchive.com/SN74S262N-datasheet.html
The complete character set now looks like this when displayed in MAME:
!image
which matches the COS 3.4 character tables shown on pages 2.3 and 2.5 of the Firmware reference manual:
https://vt100.net/rm/docs/pn10971.pdf
This is my new sn74s262 romset:
sn74s262.zip
I've used the same format as the existing sn74s263 ROM which was also created by hand, but have only included the 1280 bytes used
  for the 128 characters in the sn74s262 character set.  The other ROM seems to include further characters, but only the first 128
  are actually accessible using the device.
The main benefit of this is that the special characters, such as arrow symbols, are now drawn properly as can be seen from the
  following Front Panel screenshot.  It also means we don't need the silly zero -> 'O' hack anymore.
!image
This is my assembler program to display the character set:
charset_vdu40.zip
I also wrote a Python program to display and edit the character ROM if anybody is interested.  It's just something I hacked together
  for this task, but I might make it more generic eventually.

Bu Bu Car (English) [Victor Fernandez (City Game), Recreativas.org]
We haven't desoldered and dumped the surface mounted flash ROMs because we'd better wait for the program ROM to be decrypted (by
  anyone able of doing it) so we can then run a trojan and extract the CPU internal ROM.

12137: casio/cfx9850.cpp: Various fixes [qufb]
- Fix CFX9850GB `display_ram` mapping, this one doesn't write to segment 0x60;
- Debugger edits to register values were all being incorrectly applied to the first register, now they should go to the
  corresponding set of 4 registers;
- Implement TIME register;
- Add more instructions tested on hardware;
- Fix swap flags, they are always cleared regardless of values;
- Fix timer so that it expires on KO enabled key input;
- Add an infinite timer variant, which seems to only be used along with the low power variant of `timer_wait`;
- Prefer more accurate palette taken from an online Casio manual, although it isn't clear what contrast levels they used for those
  screenshots;

12144: rm/rm380z.cpp: Correct floppy disk handling so double sided disks work and also add support for 8 inch disks [RobinSergeant]
Double sided disks would not load before because the floppy drives were wrongly configured as single sided.  The wrong control port
  bit was also being used to select the side.  After fixing this I can load more software and access the second side of double sided
  disks (logical drives C: and D:).
I've also added support for 8 inch disks used by the /F firmware variants such as "COS 3.4D/F".  The "/F" refers to FDS (Full Disc
  System - 8") as opposed to MDS (Mini Disc System - 5.25"), which is designated by "/M".
FDS and MDS actually use different ports, so I've also updated the IO port map to include both sets.  The firmware guide shows both
  as being reserved for FDC use.  NB the control port address is not fully decoded and can actually be written to using 4 addresses
  which is why I've expanded this.
I have tested various double sided MDS disks, but have not been able to test FDS as there don't seem to be any 8" disk dumps
  available.  However, it does now show the "Disk not ready" message when trying to boot without a disk (previously nothing happened
  when trying to boot with COS 3.4D).

12149: rm/rm380z.cpp: Add sound for COS 4.0 [RobinSergeant]
This PR adds sound for COS 4.0 only as the beep control character, and escape codes to change the beep duration and frequency are
  not supported by COS 3.4.  The firmware guide lists these as only being implemented in COS 4.0 and later releases.
With this change <Ctrl+G> beeps, and more excitingly music is played in the "Go West" game!  It plays a recognisable rendition of
  "Coming 'Round the Mountain" and another tune when you reach San Francisco.  I have not found any other software with sound yet.

12152: nmk16.cpp: The new MCU based GFX decryption method is added for rest of games [sergiopolog]
The new gfx decryption method and mcu dump are added to every game (and clones) which use it on the driver:
- `macross`
- `gunnail`
- `bjtwin`
- `nouryoku`
Internal ROM on NMK215 is the same for all games, so the dump already included for `saboten` is now added for the rest of the games.
Old method is still in use for bootleg clones in which the actual decryption process used is still not in-depth documented.
- Also updated CPU clock for `mustang` (and clones) to proper value and added notes about bootlegs [hammy]

12166: rm/rm380z.cpp: Fix 8" disk clock frequency and minor VDU-80 display improvements [RobinSergeant]
The RM 8" disk format is actually the IBM-3740 standard which means that generic CP/M disks in this format are compatible.  By
  testing these I've discovered that the FD-1771 square wave clock frequency needs to be changed for 8" disks.  This PR does that
  and allows such disks to load.  For example, I've just played the Infocom text adventure Zork from an 8" disk image :-)
I have also removed the slot device "fixed" restriction to allow switching between MDS and FDS drives.  It is actually possible to
  use FDS drives with MDS firmware if you patch the CP/M disk parameter tables, i.e boot from MDS disk in drive A:, then patch the
  disk parameter tables for drive B: before using with FDS disks!  I have written an assembler program to do just that.  The extra
  disk space allows larger CP/M programs to load which is actually very useful.  Apparently RM originally used something similar to
  transfer data between the two systems.
Display improvements include supporting the VID INHIB port flag which is used to control whether text is displayed with HRG or not.
  There is an escape sequence for switching between these modes, which of course now works.

    threading is still not actually functional in the Emscripten target.
 * The change in behaviour appears to be due to emscripten-core/emscripten@690f1bdb9ecac731a071225d33cb5b4a192144e9
