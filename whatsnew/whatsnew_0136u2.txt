MAMETesters Bugs Fixed
----------------------
- 03667: [Interface] All default/per-game .cfg files are not saved 
         correctly (Aaron Giles)
- 03671: [Sound] fcrash: Bad sound ingame (Mamesick)

Source Changes
--------------
Replaced vsnetscr GFX ROMs with correct dumps 
[Team Japump, Dumping Union]

Fixed memory allocation issue in debug builds. [Aaron Giles]

Added makefile autotest for BIGENDIAN. A bit hacked, though.
[couriersud]

Redumped sound roms in Cyber Tank 
[Antonio Gonzalez Jr., Dumping Union]

psikyosh improvements: [PsikyoFan]
 * Add support for per-scanline scroll/zoom and per-column effects. 
   This is adds a significant performance penalty when enabled. 
   Removed warning flag from s1945ii and s1945iii. s1945iii needs 
   confirmation of correctness and x-zoom is a guess.
 * Virtually completed video rendering. Only flipscreen missing (and 
    conversion to tilemaps one day). Per-line effects now respect 
    per-line alpha, priority and bank. As a result daraku text works 
    without any hacks.
 * Added various optimisations to get back all games to a playable 
    speed.
 * Fixed missing soldivid effect on final boss that was broken due to 
    above daraku hack.
 * Added accurate scaling effects based on measurements from hardware.

cybertnk improvements: [Angelo Salese]
 * Fixed sprite height
 * Implemented flip x and negative y offsets
 * Implemented preliminary zooming

    debugger.
 - On targets supporting "-m64" and "-m32" use them.
 - On unix ppc targets, add -Dpowerpc automatically

Improved stack walking on crash in Windows. Now using StackWalk64 to
do the stack walk, resulting in cleaner logs. Also will try to use
system function to look up symbol and source/line information if
present. [Aaron Giles]

Created new template class tagged_list which manages a simple list
along with a tagmap. Changed memory regions, input ports, and devices
to use this class. For devices, converted typenext and classnext
fields into methods which dynamically search for the next item.
Changed a number of macros to use the features of the class, removing
the need for a bunch of helper functions. [Aaron Giles]

Replaced device_find_child_by_tag() -> device->subdevice().

Added Am29000 CPU core [Phil Bennett]

Removed stdlib.h from osdcomm.h. [couriersud]
 - Added #include stdlib.h where now necessary
 - Fixed Solaris build
 - Fixed building unidasm for OSD=sdl on win32

Tools now include stdlib.h where needed. [couriersud]

Changed core library files to use osd_malloc/osd_free where 
appropriate. [couriersud]

Added checkautodetect target to makefile. [couriersud]

Permit zlib and expat to be linked dynamically without changing the 
makefile by specifying "=0": make BUILD_ZLIB=0 BUILD_EXPAT=0
[couriersud]

Converted the following drivers to use a driver_data structure: 
[Atari Ace]
 - bigstrkb, mugsmash, pass, sbugger, sderby, shadfrce, shootout,
    silkroad, spbactn, sslam, stlforce, taitojc, tunhunt,
    welltris, wwfsstar, xyonix
 - 39in1, safarir, sbowling, shougi, skeetsht, skyarmy, sliver,
    spoker, spool99, srmp5, srmp6, ssingles, sstrangr, sub, supdrapo,
    superdq, supertnk, suprgolf

hng64 : Implemented low-res texture decoding.  All red/green polygons 
should now be textured. [Andrew Gardner]

Correct a long-standing design flaw: device configuration state is
now separate from runtime device state: [Aaron Giles]

 * There is a new class 'running_device' which represents the
    state of a live device. A list of these running_devices sits
    in machine->devicelist and is created when a running_machine
    is instantiated.

 * To access the configuration state, use device->baseconfig()
    which returns a reference to the configuration.

 * The list of running_devices in machine->devicelist has a 1:1
    correspondance with the list of device configurations in
    machine->config->devicelist, and most navigation options work
    equally on either (scanning by class, type, etc.)

 * For the most part, drivers will now deal with running_device
    objects instead of const device_config objects. In fact, in
    order to do this patch, I did the following global search &
    replace:

      const device_config -> running_device
      device->static_config -> device->baseconfig().static_config
      device->inline_config -> device->baseconfig().inline_config

    and then fixed up the compiler errors that fell out.

 * Removed device_get_info_* functions and replaced them with
    methods called get_config_*.
  
 * Added methods for get_runtime_* to access runtime state from
    the running_device.
  
 * DEVICE_GET_INFO callbacks are only passed a device_config *.
    This means they have no access to the token or runtime state
    at all. For most cases this is fine.
  
 * Added new DEVICE_GET_RUNTIME_INFO callback that is passed
    the running_device for accessing data that is live at runtime.
    In the future this will go away to make room for a cleaner
    mechanism.
  
 * Cleaned up the handoff of memory regions from the memory
    subsystem to the devices.

Fix bug introduced with astring changes that caused malformed tokens
when writing out cfg files. [Aaron Giles]

Fix bug where memory regions were not properly enumerated for the
debugger memory view. Also, stop creating empty regions for disk 
regions. [Aaron Giles]

Added Guru(TM)-readme to trackfld. [Curt Coder]

Refactored the CIA 6526 interface, adding SP/CNT callbacks. Fixed 
serial transfer. [Curt Coder]

Convrted the rest of devintrf to classes and moved management
functions into methods of those classes. The most wide-ranging
change was converting device_reset() to device->reset(). Apart
from that it was mostly internal shuffling in the core. [Aaron Giles]

Added OS/2 autodetect to makefile. [couriersud]

Autodetection of PTR64 can be inhibited now by specifying PTR64=0.
On mixed 32bit/64bit targets identifying themselves as 64bit this can 
be used to build a 32bit executable. [couriersud]

Added OpenBSD support in makefile/sdl.mak. Fixed XBSD detection of 
PTR64 (uses amd64). [couriersud]

Fix bug that mistook a non-NULL token to mean that a device was 
started. Fixes -video ddraw issue. [Aaron Giles]

Replaced vsnes bank installs with RAM installs, since the banks were 
never changed. [Aaron Giles]

Exit from the unhandled exception filter cleanly now. Use 
SetErrorMode() to disable the appearance of dialog boxes when crashes 
occur. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed a typo in pgm.c that was causing a memory test error and 
corrected some comments [XingXing]

Made direct accessors for device configuration state. Currently they
just call through to the get info function. Removed old macros that
wrapped calls. [Aaron Giles]

Removed some aliases between CPUINFO_ and DEVINFO_ to help clarify
usage. Also converted a few more places to use the new accessors.
[Aaron Giles]

Replaced drgninja set with one dumped from a genuine Data East PCB 
[dlfrsilver]

Added MEC-M1 PCB layout to the dec0 driver and updated some clocks 
and ROM names [Guru]

hng64 : Partially decodes translation-only geometry type 0102. This 
makes the road appear in the racing games, the edge of the ring in 
buriki, and a hallway during the buriki attract. [Andrew Gardner]

The return of the "misc" [couriersud]
 - Added sdlmisc_<targetos>.c again. This was necessary since
    certain tools create stubs for e.g. osd_break_into_debugger.
    If we do not have this in a separate file, the link stage may
    break.
 - Applied OS/2 patch [Credit: KO Myung-Hun]
 - Cleaned up #includes. Removed stdlib.h were possible.
 - More malloc to osd_malloc rename.
 - SDL monitor modes are read now when they are needed. This is now 
    consistent across platforms.

GTK Debugger work [couriersud]
 - glade-2 can now be used again to edit the debug.glade file. 
 - No more need to edit the files created by glade-2
 - All "activate" handlers now pass the parent window pointer.
 - malloc ==> osd_malloc to prevent mixed c++/c window allocations.
 - Run to cursor (main view)
 - In place memory editing (memory view)
 - implement key handling (Up, down, ..) like in windows
 - Tab and ESC not yet handled
 - Functionality now matches win32 debugger
 - Further code review/rewrite/simplification
 - Added more comment headings
 - fix a compile warning for gcc-4.4 (not detected by gcc-4.2)
 - Horizontal divider bar to individually size views.
 - minimum height aligned to win32 debugger 

ARM: preliminary SA-1110 support [R. Belmont]

Verified all deco32 clocks and corrected HuC6280 clock following old 
Charles McDonald notes I had about internal divisor. Added a note on 
the Arm cpu used by this game: it's a Data East 101 custom 
[Corrado Tomaselli]

Changed the following games to use the 76489A variant (verified on my 
pcbs): Green Beret, Do Run Run, Mr.Do's Castle, Jail Break, 
Shaolin's Road, Yie Ar Kung-Fu [Corrado Tomaselli]

Fixed sn76489a periodic noise once again (and simplified a bit of 
code), now should be closer to or match real chips as sampled. Added 
true clock divider emulation, so emulation may be a bit slower. 
[Lord Nightmare, PlgDavid, Kold666]

Popmessages can now be used in drivers which have an MC6845.
[Curt Coder]

Ensure that RAM and bitmaps are cleared when the ms32 driver is 
started to avoid 64-bit build crashes [David Haywood]

Converted HD63484 ACRTC to be device. [Fabio Priuli]

hng64 : Hacks the camera to work in sams64.  [Andrew Gardner]

Fixed crash issues with mchampdx [Fabio Priuli]

s14001a: updated comments; got rid of the squealing noise (hidden 
behind a #define now, code is still there) until some other issues 
can be resolved. [Lord Nightmare]

Dumped the proms in D-Day (Jaleco) [Chack'n, Team Japump]

Fixed background and sprites colors in D-Day (Jaleco) [Angelo Salese]

UI menu interface changes [couriersud]
 - all ui functions now expect a render_container
 - removed all macros referencing render_container_get_ui
 - ui_menu_alloc now is passed a container to which to render the menu.
