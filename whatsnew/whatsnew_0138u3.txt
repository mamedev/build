Changed emualloc to free resource pools from earliest to latest so
that early objects can safely clean up stuff they allocated. 
[Aaron Giles]

Changed device name from an overridable function to a parameter passed
to the device_config constructor. In situations where the proper name
is not known at construction time, a generic name can be specified and
then overridden later once the configuration is complete. [Aaron Giles]

Decapped 89C51 MCU in Real Battle Mahjong King [Dr. Decapitator, Guru]

metro.c: Added Puzzlet's MCU internal ROM. Zilog Z8 8-bit family MCU
requires a new CPU core to be written. [Dr. Decapitator]

War MCU simulation. [Aaron Giles, Dr. Decapitator]

cps2.c: Correct the release order for the Xmen: Cota (Hispanic) sets
[gregf]

Made the machine_config a proper object. Added detokenize method to
this object which can be called multiple times to append new devices
after the initial machine configuration is set up. Updated member
variables to match new naming convention. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the running_machine to take a constructed machine_config
object in the constructor, instead of creating one itself, for
consistency. Also added machine->total_colors() as a shortcut to
machine->config->m_total_colors. [Aaron Giles]

firetrap.c: Added PCB documentation, corrected ROM names, corrected
clocks [Guru]

idsoccer: Improved DIP locations, confirmed MSM5205 clock
[Kevin Eshbach]

Fixed title screen colors in Bogey Manor
[Angelo Salese, Stefan Lindberg]

Modified way device_type constants are defined in order to get unidasm
compile [Miodrag Milanovic]

Changed autmoon (aristmk4) romload to proper crc/sha hashes.  The
submitted romset contained a 32kb (u87.bin) which actually appeared to
be an 8k overdumped. [Tafoid]

slapfght.c: Corrected rom names for the Slap Fight sets and added PCB
locations to any set where possible. Added Dipswitch locations to Slap
Fight.  Moved PCB information down to matching rom sets.
[Brian Troha, Guru]

Split mame.c into mame.c and machine.c, the latter containing the
running_machine definition and implementation. [Aaron Giles]

Moved global machine-level operations and accessors into methods on
the running_machine class. For the most part, this doesn't affect
drivers except for a few occasional bits: [Aaron Giles]

  mame_get_phase() == machine->phase() 
  add_reset_callback() == machine->add_notifier(MACHINE_NOTIFY_RESET, ...) 
  add_exit_callback() == machine->add_notifier(MACHINE_NOTIFY_EXIT, ...)
  mame_get_base_datetime() == machine->base_datetime()
  mame_get_current_datetime() == machine->current_datetime()

Cleaned up the region_info class, removing most global region
accessors except for memory_region() and memory_region_length().
Again, this doesn't generally affect drivers. [Aaron Giles]

Resurrect the old sampling profiler, and improve it to be useful:
[Aaron Giles]
 * always available now, just specify -profile <n> to enable it
 * supports stack walking to uniquely identify call chains; the <n>
    parameter to the -profile option specifies how deep to go
 * automatically turns off throttling and multithreading, and sets the
    number of processors available to 1 (since we only sample the main
    thread)
 * output now uses the common symbol lookup, which actually uses the
    PDB for MSVC builds and sym files for gcc builds
 * the top 30 unique call chains are output

Fix performance regression for PowerPC games. The timing made heavy
use of cpu_get_total_cycles() which is now slow. Better to use the
legacy_cpu_device directly and call device->total_cycles() which
avoids the dynamic_cast to find the execute interface from a generic
device. [Aaron Giles]

Added cycles_to_attotime() and attotime_to_cycles() which is more
often what is requested. (Clocks are the raw input clock, while cycles
are internal clock after dividers/multipliers.) [Aaron Giles]

Removed most other instances of cpu_get_total_cycles. [Aaron Giles]

Removed the following functions: [Aaron Giles]
  cpu_get_total_cycles()   == cpudevice->total_cycles()
  cpu_clocks_to_attotime() == cpudevice->cycles_to_attotime()
  cpu_attotime_to_clocks() == cpudevice->attotime_to_cycles()

Correct dipswitch location order in World Rally to match actual dips
as seen by the game / service menu. [Brian Troha]

namcos22.c: updated ridgerac, raveracw and acedrvrw to use keys
instead of dipswitches for shifters [Fabio Priuli]

Added COPX romloading for sets that didn't have it, marked as BAD_DUMP
until the assumption that they're the same is (un)confirmed. [hap]

Winmain cleanup: [Aaron Giles]
 * created dynamic_bind<> template class to handle dynamically binding
    to optionally-supported functions
 * wrapped stack walking code in a class
 * wrapped symbol lookup code in a class
 * added support for parsing objdump-produced symbol dumps which
    include non-global functions for much better stack dumps and
    profiling in gcc builds

Modified makefile for win32 targets to automatically run objdump
and produce a .sym file if SYMBOLS is enabled. [Aaron Giles]

Update cheat loading to support image devices (moved implementation
from MESS), use only CRC of first found image. [Miodrag Milanovic]

Removed cpu_get_sp(). [Aaron Giles]

Added overrides to fetch the execute, memory and state interfaces 
without doing a dynamic_cast<> to speed up common legacy operations.
[Aaron Giles]

Created CPU-specific device types for all CPUs, using new macros
DECLARE_LEGACY_CPU_DEVICE and DEFINE_LEGACY_CPU_DEVICE. Changed CPUs
to be their own device types, rather than all of type CPU with a
special internal subtype. Note that as part of this process I removed
the CPU_ prefix from the ALL-CAPS device name, so CPU_Z80 is just
plain old Z80 now. This required changing a couple of names like 8080
to I8080 so that there was an alphabetic first character. [Aaron Giles]

Hooked up Heavy Barrel I8751 MCU [Bryan McPhail, Dr. Decapitator] 

[cb2001] added 2 new opcodes [robiza]

Hooked up Gondomania I8751 MCU [Bryan McPhail, Dr. Decapitator]

Reimplemented Meikyuu Hunter G I8751 MCU according to schematics
[Bryan McPhail]

Software list update: [Wilbert Pol]
 - Software list xml files are now read in full such that information 
    for clone and parent sets is available.
 - Added validity check to check for existence of parent sets.

Imported image related utils from MESS into /lib/util [Miodrag Milanovic]

Improved video emulation in cb2001 [David Haywood]

Added support for Sega 317-5000 decryption (same as 315-5177). 
Reorganised decryption code. [Nicola Salmoria]

Moved debugging structure away from CPUs only and attached to all
devices. Debugger now creates one for each device. C++-ified most
debugger operations to hang off the debugging class, and updated
most callers. [Aaron Giles]

Got rid of cpu_count, cpu_first, cpu_next, etc. as they were badly 
broken. Also removed cpu_is_executing, cpu_is_suspended,
cpu_get_local_time, and cpu_abort_timeslice. [Aaron Giles]

Software list improvements: [Miodrag Milanovic]
 - Support for multiple software list per driver 
 - Added MDRV_SOFTWARE_LIST_COMPATIBLE_ADD for adding compatible 
    software lists (for documentation purposes) [Miodrag Milanovic]
 - listsoftware option now return only original software lists
 - UI is updated to enable mounting software items per device, it 
    will display only items from list that are for specific device
 - Separate compatible software lists in UI
