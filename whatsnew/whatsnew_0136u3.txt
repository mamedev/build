 - ui_input_frame_update is now global 
 - moved element_component from rendlay.c to rendlay.h
 - added ability to rendlay.c to define "container" components. These 
    simply provide a render_container. 

Added DEBUG_FLAG_OSD_ENABLED to allow coexistence of debuggers going 
forward. Replaced all occurrences of OPTION_DEBUG in src/osd/* by 
checking machine->debug_flags. Replaced all occurrences of 
DEBUG_FLAG_ENABLED in src/osd/* by DEBUG_FLAG_OSD_ENABLED For the 
time being, DEBUG_FLAG_OSD_ENABLED is default (set in mame.c).
[couriersud]

'bongo', 'porter'. [stephh]

Implemented Actel FPGA ID, used by some Naomi games for accessing a 
special ROM check mode [Deunan Knute, Angelo Salese]

map chip info. [Brian Troha]

Doesn't do much at the moment, but the increase in documentation value is
significant (we're documenting the sample compression format, for one thing).

New driver for Sigma B52 system. ACRTC implementation is a bit hacky 
due to its preliminary emulation status. [Roberto Fresca]

lethal.c - Verified clocks and vsync from orginal PCB 
[Corrado Tomaselli]

astrocorp.c update: [Luca Elia]

Hooked up coin input and start input in skattv. [robiza]

astrocde.c - Fixed the Bonus Life dipswitch for gorf and clones. 
It's state was inverted. [Tafoid]

[I8255] Clear output lines to 0 on write to mode register, and float 
input lines to 1. [Curt Coder]

Simplified/combined MAME and MESS code: [Miodrag Milanovic]
 - Moved compatibility validation into MAME core from MESS.
 - Made GAME_NO_SOUND check done on MESS too.
 - Removed MESS dependent checks
 - Renamed GAME_COMPUTER_MODIFIED to GAME_UNOFFICIAL to mark 
    unofficial hardware modifications
 - Removed GAME_COMPUTER it is distinct by IPT_KEYBOARD
 - Added GAME_NO_SOUND_HW (to mark that there is no sound hardware) 
    and marked drivers in dotrikun.c, minivadr.c and tgtpanic.c as 
    such
 - Removed GAME_SHARE_ROMS flag and commented old check for 
    duplicate ROM entries
 - Moved natural keyboard support from MESS to MAME
 - Moved OSD file functions and clipboard access functions into OSD 
    core
 - Significantly reduced the number of new OSD functions needed by
    MESS [with couriersud]

'tazzmang'. [stephh]

snes wip: [Fabio Priuli]
 * added a couple of registers to snes_ppu struct 
 * moved color blending (background & subscreen color 
    addition/subtraction) at the end of the drawing process. 
 * removed some unused (and not working anymore) debug code

hng64 : Initial implementation of 0x10-sized palette pages for 3d 
objects. This makes most environment colors correct in sams64. 
[Andrew Gardner]

[VIA6522] Read port A/B only if some pins are inputs. [Curt Coder]

Fixed Dip Switches and Inputs (after verification of the Z80 code) 
for 'dambustr' and clones. [stephh]

Internal debugger using the mame rendering infrastructure [couriersud]
 - added support for arbitrary number of containers for render_target
 - added command-line parameter -debug_internal (-di) to use the 
    internal debugger when in debug mode
 - internal debugger supports all views except memory view
 - added "Debug" view to layout/vertical.lay to create more place for 
    debug views in vertical games.

 NOTE: The colors are ugly. Font rendering needs improvement. There 
 are no shortcut keys right now. There is still a lot of room for more
 improvements. However, it works and does not depend on any ui 
 toolkit. The interface has been designed to support displaying views 
 programmatically e.g. from the ui. 

 Short HowTo:
  - Start MAME with "-debug -di"
  - Console, register and disasm views will be shown. Place them by 
     dragging the view on the title bar.
  - Views can be resized by dragging the bottom-right yellow square.
  - The view having the focus has a green background title bar.
  - Hit "Tab" (IPT_UI_CONFIGURE) to show the menu.
  - Console and disasm views support a very simple facility to 
     support entering commands and addresses. Just start typing. 
     Hit "enter" when finished.

irobot.c - Added XTAL values from manual and hooked up to driver for 
main/sound CPU.  [Phil Bennett/Tafoid]

rungun: fix text tilemap lookup for big-endian targets. [R. Belmont]

Added Intel 8021/8022 CPU types. [Curt Coder]

Workaround for gcc-4.3 reporting a false warning on solaris: disable 
-Werror for this file only. [couriersud]

Cleaned up SDL OSD functions after merging in code from MESS.
[couriersud]

wrally.c - Added/verified DIP Locations for World Rally [Guru]

Fixed long-standing (day one?) bug with ADPCM samples in Trojan / 
Tatakai no Banka [Mamesick, Angelo Salese]

Fixed Dip Switches and Inputs (after verification of the Z80 code) for
'espial', 'espialu' and 'netwars". [stephh]
