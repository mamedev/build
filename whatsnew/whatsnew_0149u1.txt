-chihiro: few updates to the i386 processor and chihiro driver.
 [Samuele Zannoli]
 * adds lots of mmx and sse opcodes to the i386 processor
 * adds the fcomip x87 opcode
 * adds a "UINT8 *memory(UINT32 &size)" method to the
    naomi_gdrom_board device that returns the size and a pointer to
    the decrypted gdrom data (used by chihiro) Then for the chihiro
    driver:
 * adds basic stuff for the Nvidia audio APU
 * adds the "chihiro curthread" debugger command, shows information
    about the current active thread
 * adds the "chihiro irq,<number>" debugger command, to generate an
    interrupt with irq number 0-15 by hand
 * adds more patches to let the software run even if usb is not
    implemented
 * adds the Chihiro Type 1 baseboard/mediaboard features to let the
    system load the gdrom games
 * adds incomplete save state support
 * adds support to the Nvidia 3d accelerator to draw primitives where
    the vertex data is not stored in a vertex buffer but contained in
    the command stream

-IDE: Uses one timer instead of anonymous timers, so that resetting the
 device will stop any outstanding work. BSY is always set when waiting
 for the busy timer to fire. Implemented DASP & PDIAG functionality,
 device 1 is detected during reset & if device 1 fails diagnostic then
 device 0 sets bit 7 of it's diagnostic result. Ide cards now default
 to 1 hard disk, otherwise device 1 without a chd will cause device 0
 to report a controller error (AMIBIOS for example doesn't allow
 booting from device 0 if device 1 fails). Timing of DASP & PDIAG is
 set very short because of lack of wait states when accessing ATA bus.
 Improved SRST functionality, which has meant viper needed to be
 changed to trigger a hard reset instead of a soft reset. Writes to the
 command register are now ignored with BSY or DRQ is set (packet
 devices can accept the DEVICE RESET command but they are not supported
 yet). [smf]

-toaplan2.c: bgaregga DSW3 really are dipswitches and not
 "configuration". Also, make bbakraid inputs inherit from very similar
 batrider [Alex Jackson]
 
-Don't crash if pcap can't find a network interface's name [Richard L. Hamilton]

-RSP SSE optimizations/changes: [MooglyGuy]
 * Fixed load/store opcodes
 * Added SSE versions of the following opcodes: VMADH, VADD, VSUB,
   VADDC, VSUBC, VCH, VCR, VMRG, VAND, VNAND, VOR, VNOR, VXOR, and VNXOR

    hellfire1  "Hellfire (1P set)" hellfire2 -> hellfire2a "Hellfire
    (2P set, older)" hellfire1 -> hellfire1a "Hellfire (1P set,

-QS1000 sound core issue now not a mandatory include which allows tiny

-Fixed some unknown DIPs and corrected others from manual examinations
 for lethalj.c  [Bad A Billy]

-Memory system: added endianness to the memory_share class.  [Aaron Giles]

-Tilemap system: numerous changes:  [Aaron Giles]
 * Moved remaining legacy macros and typedefs to tilelgcy.h. This
    revealed a few drivers mixing and matching modern & legcy, which
    have now been fixed.
 * Changed get info callback signature to no longer pass the user_data
    pointer, but instead pass a reference to the tilemap object
    itself. Updated those few drivers using user_data to pull it out
    of the tilemap object with the new user_data() getter method.
 * Changed get info and mapping callbacks to be device_delegates so
    that they can be described at config time.
 * Added tilemap_memory object that is used internally for reading/
    writing to memory that backs a tilemap. This object is used to
    track a memory pointer that backs tilemap memory, and also is
    designed to transparently handle all bus width and endianness
    associated with reading and writing data in a tilemap.
 * Incorporated two tilemap_memory objects (basemem and extmem) into
    the tilemap object and added accessors to them, as well as
    read/write handlers for reading/writing to entries stored in the
    memory. This means that tilemap get info callbacks can now easily
    read data out of the tilemap in a generic way.
 * Rejiggered the initialization sequence for tilemap objects so that
    the tilemap_manager is not required to be present at
    instantiation.
 * Created a new tilemap_device, which can be used to declare a
    tilemap in the machine config, and which also is a tilemap object
    itself. The tilemap device will look for shared memory regions
    called "<tag>" and "<tag>_ext" and automatically plug them into
    the tilemap. The device also provides write handlers that can be
    used to write to the tilemap memory and mark tiles dirty, saving
    the need for each driver to write their own.

-Device system: moved required/optional device finders to a new header
 devfind.h.  [Aaron Giles]

-Atari drivers: removed all playfield and alpha memory and tilemap  [Aaron Giles]
 variables, apart from those needed by atarivc-using games (this will
 become a device in a future update). Updated all Atari 16-bit drivers
 to use the new tilemap_device instead, which provides all the needed
 functionality in a more generic way.

-volfied.c: Added dipswitch locations to the Volfied sets. [Brian Troha]

-thepit.c: Added dipswitch locations to The Pit, Round-Up / Fitter,
 Intrepid and Dock Man / Port Man sets. Gave Desert Dan it's own
 dipswitches and corrected them based on results of game play. [Brian Troha]

-suna8.c: Added dipswitch locations to Rough Ranger / Super Ranger,
 Hard Head, Spark Man, Star Fighter, Hard Head 2 and Brick Zone sets.
 Correct default settings as per manuals. [Brian Troha]

-toaplan1.c: [Alex Jackson]
 * Reorganized outzone sets and improved descriptions: outzonec  ->
    outzone  "Out Zone"          (new parent) outzone   -> outzoneh
    "Out Zone (harder)" (former parent) outzonea  -> outzonea "Out
    Zone (old set)" outzoned  -> outzoneb "Out Zone (older set)"
    outzoneb  -> outzonec "Out Zone (oldest set)"
 * Fixed dip switches and inputs (after verification of the M68000 and
    Z80 code) in outzone and clones
 * Tagged outzonec (formerly outzoneb) Z80 ROM as BAD_DUMP and the set
    itself as GAME_IMPERFECT_SOUND after discovering that this clone's
    M68000 and Z80 ROMs are almost certainly mismatched, causing wrong
    sound effects.

-stfight.c: Added dipswitch locations to the Empire City: 1931 / Street
 Fight sets. [Brian Troha]

-shanghai.c: Added dipswitch locations to Shanghai and Shanghai 2.
 [Brian Troha]

-itech32.c: Some minor corrections of dipswitches. Added a note about
 the Japanese World Class Bowling trackball input is read at an 45
 degree offset compared to normal orientation. [Brian Troha]

-Data East Protection Work [Charles MacDonald, David Haywood]
 * Complete new Data East 146 emulation based on extensive hardware
   tests.  The following now use a single implementation rather than
   incomplete per-game implementations
   Edward Randy (60)
   Mutant Fighter (66)
   Captain America (75)
   Lemmings (75)
   Robocop 2 (75)
   Super Shanghai Dragon's Eye (146)
   Funky Jet (146)
   Sotsugyo Shousho (146)
   Nitro Ball (146)
   Fighter's History (146)
   Stadium Hero 96 (146)
   Dragon Gun (146)
   Lock 'n' Loaded (146)
 * This fixes glitches in Fighter's History and Edward Randy in
   addition to bringing Super Shanghai to a working state.
 * Similar work has been started for the 104 based games, but no
   complete table has been derived from real hardware yet.

-Split the KonamiIC file into individual device files and moved all
 implementations of each device into those files, started to unify
 some code between the GX/Non-GX cases in addition to heavy cleanup of
 variable usage / names.  [David Haywood]
