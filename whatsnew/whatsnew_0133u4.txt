    in the source file for the disassembler (sometimes new generic
    versions were created)

 * Rerouted some inputs to mantain the inputs layout.
 * Renamed some inputs to match the text with the real cab buttons.
 * Removed the imperfect colors flag from the existent sets.
 * Added 2 different control panel layouts to the source.
 * Updated technical notes.

Fixed redundancy in clock speed assignments in some drivers by 
cleaning all divided by 1 (/1) instances. [Tafoid]

Argonaut SuperFX core improvements: [Anonymous]
 - Hooked up Branch instructions 
 - Fixed numerous SuperFX core bugs.
 - Improved disassembler to more gracefully handle ALT* opcode effects.
 - Corrected instruction behaviors: STOP, SUB, SBC, SUBI, CMP
 - Added LSR and ROL opcodes
 - Updated instructions to use the safer superfx_gpr_write: LOOP, 
    PLOT, INC, DEC
 - Added missing register writeback to LMS
 - Corrected carry flag behavior in ROL opcode
 - Corrected BRA target address calculation (maybe still wrong)
 - Corrected LOOP target address calculation
 - Made sure that FROM sets cpustate->sreg_idx
 - Disabled RAM/ROM clocking, going with instant transfer for now
 - Understood and re-enabled pipelined instruction architecture, Star 
    Fox runs farther
 - Fixed a ridiculous typo in ROL instruction
 - Fixed overflow flag calculation on ADDI / ADCI
 - Fixed lack of register reset after ADD / ADC / ADDI / ADCI

tmaster.c update [Luca Elia]
- implemented carts banking and multiple EEPROMs
- added "pen replacement" blit mode
- fixed palette size

Discrete work [couriersud] 
 - change the way custom modules are handled
 - updated drivers mario and dkong accordingly
 - minor change to stream input handling
 - no more linear lists for nodes. All node processing switched to 
    linked lists.
 - module step and reset now only get a node pointer passed
 - Added discrete_info * pointer to node
 - Only nodes with a step routine actually get processed.
 - Fixed a bug: discrete logs did not work since some time
 - preliminary parallel task constants; depending on results these may 
    vanish again.
 - Overall slight performance increase. dkong 940% to 960%, galaxian 
    740% to 790%

Fix NULL timers crash in the mc6845. [hap]

Fixed IM2 interrupt cycles in the Z80 core. [eke]

kaneko16 updates:

    [David Haywood, Tomasz Slanina]
 - Cleaned up decryption function for B.Rap Boys external Rom 
    [David Haywood]
 - Improved video emulation for B.Rap Boys [David Haywood]

    addresses, allowing B.Rap Boys to boot [Tomasz Slanina]
 - Redumped GFX Roms [Guru]
 - Added hitbox simulation based on suprnova / game requirements 
    [Tomasz Slanina]
 - Converted MCU writes to use write_byte [David Haywood]
 - Added kludge to reset MCU data write address to prevent game from 
    running out of ram and crashing [David Haywood]
 - Added DSWs [David Haywood]
 - Added eeprom support to the B Rap Boys protection simulation 
    [David Haywood]
 - Change to priorities to fix some visibility problems. 
    [David Haywood]

Added correct U2 sound ROM to the mk3 sets [MK3Fan - Mike]

Discrete sound parallel tasks support: [couriersud]
 - Introduced DISCRETE_TASK_START, DISCRETE_TASK_END
 - DISCRETE_TASK_START: Start a new task. A task is a set of nodes 
    which only depend on input nodes and nodes in the set
 - DISCRETE_TASK_END(task_output_node): Marks the end of the task. 
    task_output_node is the node whose output over time should be 
    preserved. This node can be accessed by nodes in the main thread.
 - Illustrated the concept in the dkong discrete emulation. This also 
    has been enhanced to buffer DAC output. 
 - Discrete tasks now support multiple task output nodes

Further discrete changes: [couriersud]
 - DISCRETE_OUTPUT now is a stepping node.
 - DISCRETE_STREAM_INPUT now advances input pointer in step.
 - More linked_list usage.

Pit Boss driver updates: [Brian Troha]
 - Corrected rom names for the Megastar & Supertouch 30
 - Added missing rom to Supertouch 30 and verified old bad_dumps
 - Added documentation about the Megastar sets

    name, IE: Pit Boss Supertouch 30 (9234-10-01)

Fixed B-Rap Boys sound banking [Phil Bennett]

Sigma Poker: Fixed duplicated definition of Hold 2 button. Added the 
missing Hold 3 button. [Roberto Fresca]

Continued discrete sound system "list-ification": [couriersud]
 - No more constraints on number of input and output nodes
 - input nodes now make use of a context

Removed osd_is_bad_read_ptr function. [Aaron Giles]
