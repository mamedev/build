Source Changes
--------------
Fixed problems with i2cmem. Cubo CD32 games now save and load settings
properly. [Mariusz Wojcieszek]

Cleaned up many duplicate inputs and fixed others in a number of
drivers.  [Tafoid]

SDL: Support -uifont for using arbitrary TrueType fonts on Linux/BSD
builds. This takes full pathname/filename to the font, and the name 
can have styles appended as in Windows: [b] for bold, [i] for italic, 
[s] for strikethrough, and [u] for underlined.  Fonts are rendered at 
a size of 120 points and scaled down by the core, which looks superb 
on high-res displays.  (Liberation Sans that comes with most recent
distros looks really good). [R. Belmont]

   Warning: Linux/BSD builds now require SDL_ttf 2.x.  On Fedora the
   required package names are "SDL_ttf" and "SDL_ttf-devel".

tms7000: Corrected two opcodes: typo in inv_b and JPZ was wrong in
official TI document. [Gilles Fetis]

SDL: -uifont now can also look up system font families like Windows
[R. Belmont]

Take some driver_device classes that cover multiple drivers and 
split them so that each driver gets their own driver_device class.  
In most cases, these drivers got entangled because of audio/mcu code 
that was shared between multiple drivers: [Atari Ace]

 * espial/marineb/zodiak
       - common code duplicated
 * m52/m57/m58/m62/travrusa
       - common code in audio/irem.c
 * junofrst/pooyan/rallyx/rocnrope/timeplt/tutankm
       - common code in audio/timeplt.c
 * hyperspt/sbasketb/trackfld/yiear
       - common code in audio/trackfld and audio/hyprolyb.c
 * 40love/bking/buggychl/msisaac
       - common code in machine/buggychl.c

[Tim Lindner, R. Belmont]

Added Button 3 to the original Yie Ar Kung-Fu boardsets.  While not
shown in manual, there is function for these buttons and the emulation
should account for this possibility. Mapping is off by default.
[Tafoid]

[D. Beneke, M. David, Smitdogg, The Dumping Union]

    anymore

[The Dumping Union]

Hooked up MSM5205 sample playback routines to Rougien, disabled by
default because sample start write handler is still a mystery
[Angelo Salese]

Updated Naomi/Naomi2 M2/M3 encryption. [Andreas Naive]

Fix F4 shortcut so it explicitly labels the address as a number by
preceding it with "0x". This allows F4 to work properly, for example,
on the 68000 stepping to address a6, which also happens to be a
register name. [Aaron Giles]

More updates to Naomi/Naomi2 M2/M3 decryption. [Andreas Naive]

Added proper sample playback in Rougien [Andrew Welburn, Angelo
Salese]

Split the screen device into a separate module. Converted global video
