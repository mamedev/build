Fixed i86/i386 POP SP and POP ESP thanks to bug report for Xenix boot
by bs666 [Miodrag Milanovic]

Collapsed device_config and device_t into one class. Updated all
existing modern devices and the legacy wrappers to work in this
environment. This in general greatly simplifies writing a modern
device. [Aaron Giles]

psx.c: adjusted MDEC timing to avoid lockups. Most FMVs now have
fluent video. [R. Belmont]

Fixed Z80STI interrupts. [Curt Coder]

Fixed I8255 interrupt enable. [Curt Coder]

events in Fast Lane [Angelo Salese]

Tentative experiment for Hot Chase gameplay speed ... still not 
perfect though (especially noticeable with sound) [Angelo Salese]

identifying targets and simplified the code. [Aaron Giles]

naomi: Abstract the maple and jvs interfaces into a set of devices
[O. Galibert, MetalliC, Tormod, D. Knute]

Started unifying sprite implementations for setax001/x002 chips
[David Haywood]

drcbex64: Fix op_debug implementation [O. Galibert]

Add Puzznic MCU dump and added a PAL as NO_DUMP. The MCU still needs
to be properly hooked up. [Smitdogg, The Dumping Union, Lord
Nightmare]

naomi: Add jvs command 0x32, fixes Crazy Taxi and Virtua Tennis 2
booting [O. Galibert]

Added input button labels for Midway T-Unit driver [Joe Caporale]

De-stateized the NB1414M4 routines, and converted the correlated Armed
F text tilemap to be 8-bits [Angelo Salese]

Hooked up NB1414M4 to Ninja Emaki, greatly improving gfxs in it
[Angelo Salese]

Implemented serial type scrolling for Youma Ninpou Chou bootlegs
[Angelo Salese]

Support for dynamic devices added to the core. [Miodrag Milanovic]

 * Added new menu option "Slot Devices" and support to change device
    in runtime
 * Updated emuopts to support command setting of slot cards

Update clifront and added listslots option to display available
slots and device options for each one [Miodrag Milanovic]

and the link keys for setting parameters. [J Wallace]

srcclean.c: srcclean should remove invalid chars only for source files
which are not xml (softlists have UTF-8 characters) [Fabio Priuli]

Hooked up proper sound program in Combat School bootleg [Angelo
Salese]

Moved format handling and all formats to separate library
[Miodrag Milanovic]

Converted PlayStation DMA to an internal device to the CPU core. DMA
to external devices can be set in the machine config, the old calls
are still there until the rest of the code is converted. [smf]

Added support for default NVRAM in MCCS1850. [Curt Coder]

Various Irem M92 / M107 fixes [Alex Jackson]
 * Hooked up sound CPU interrupts properly, using the V35 builtin
    interrupt controller, rather than generating the vectors in the
    driver.
 * Cleaned up ROM mirroring, using AM_REGION macros in the address
    maps instead of memcpy()ing all over the place in the
    DRIVER_INITs.
 * Converted bankswitching to use configured banks. Only configure the
    banks and install the bankswitch WRITE_HANDLER in the games that
    actually use it (i.e. those with a full megabyte of program ROM).
    This and the previous change make the drivers a lot less confusing
    to look at... I hope.
 * Converted both drivers to use a scanline timer device instead of a
    hand-rolled one.
 * Added save state support to m92.c. Everything necessary was already
    saved, I just had to add the tag. However, presumably due to the
    core emu_timer breakage (MT 4330, 4331) the save states don't
    actually work at the moment. I've already reported this as MT
    #4333
 * Added GAME_MECHANICAL tag to wpksoc and clone

Converted Ginga Ninkyouden to use proper 6840 PTM device
[Angelo Salese]

Fixed missing sprite regression in the Wiz driver [Angelo Salese]
