MAMETesters Bugs Fixed
----------------------


Source Changes
--------------
-QT Debugger fixes:
 * New memory windows start focused on the active CPU.
 * Opening a utility window, closing it, and stepping no longer
    re-opens the window. [Andrew Gardner]

-shangha3.c: Added dipswitch locations to Shanghai III, Hebereke no
 Ponpoon and Blocken. [Brian Troha]

-m6502: Seriously untested multi-dispatch-table support [O. Galibert]

-coolridr: work around miscompile on newer versions of Clang
 [Phil Bennett]

-Modernized k053260 device. [Andrew Gardner]

-M740 CPU family updates: [R. Belmont, O. Galibert]
 * Support for all T=1 instructions
 * Added COM and the accumulator-only versions of INC and DEC

-namcos2: Use the correct C68 (M37450) I/O MCU for Steel Gunner 2.
 [R. Belmont, Guru, Charles MacDonald]

-aristmk4.c:  [Heihachi73]
 * Added Caribbean Gold (working), cleaned up comments and EPROM part
   numbers for a handful of games. Caribbean Gold needs some trivial
   input changes, as currently it has a logic door error on boot, however
   if you hit the coin input the error goes away and allows you to key in
   to perform a memory reset and finally coin up.

 * Also, Caribbean Gold 2 [cgold2] now has passable graphics, by using
   two of cgold's graphics ROMs (cgold u8 and u9 -> cgold2 u20 and u45)
   the game is now playable instead of a garbled mess (there are only a
   few tiles which differ between both games).

 * Promoted Caribbean Gold II and Fortune Hunter (and clone) to working -
   these had been working ever since eforest and arcwins were promoted
   but the flags were never removed.

-Add support for Mitsubishi M50740/50741 MCUs. [R. Belmont]

-shangha3.c: Corrected clock speed for Shanghai 3 and added misc
 documentation. [Brian Troha]

-Treat x & y coordinates as 11 bit signed, Ridge Racer Revolution
 loading game sets unused bits. [smf]

-M740: correct disassembly of bbs/bbc on A register. [R. Belmont]

-tms5220.c: Added correct tms5200 chirp rom derived from decap; This is
 now used for 5200, 5220 and 5220c pending decaps of the latter two.
 [digshadow, Sarayan, Lord Nightmare]

-M740: Correct disassembly for seb x,A/clb x,A [R. Belmont]

-Treat x & y coordinates as 11 bit signed on dots, lines & rectangles.

-QT Debugger: The memory view chunk size radio now reports proper
 sizes. Fixed "ignore" command reporting incorrect invalid CPUs. Fixed
 crazy code responsible for opcodes' crc32s in the comments system
 (what was I thinking back then?). [Andrew Gardner]

-315_5124.c: Small improvements to the palettes.  [Enik Land]

-i960: Add cvtilr needed by Zero Gunner. [R. Belmont]

-tms5220.c: Extremely minor fix for Speak External based on the 5220c
 and 5200 decaps, and some small documentation updates.
 [Lord Nightmare, digshadow]

-gaplus.c: Corrected some issues between Galaga 3 & Gaplus sets.
 [Brian Troha]

-Reduced time before dma interrupt is fired, as it stops incorrect
 textures being displayed in a few games and the pse bios v2.2. [smf]

-fixed GTE A1/A1/A3 flag calculation when the result exceeds the
 maximum bounds. GPF & DPCT work with all values of sf & lm [smf]

-namcos23: Update hardware readme [Guru]

-drawd3d.c - Fixes performance issues with YIQ enabled and
 prescale_x/prescale_y changes no longer impacts colors.
