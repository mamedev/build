0.33 BETA 7

New ROM sets supported (in no particular order):
------------------------------------------------

A lot of ROM renaming and moving around has been done. I know this is annoying

These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- The CPS1 games, the System 16 games, Toki, World Cup 90, Super Space
  Invaders, TMNT and Punk Shot use the dynamic palette system. [Aaron Giles]

- Rastan and Rainbow Islands use the dynamic palette. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed colors in Crater Raider. [Aaron Giles]

- Cocktail mode support in some games (invaders, btime, etc.).
  [Martin Sandiford]

- Inspired by Retrocade and Vector Dream, changed the vector games to use
  translucent vectors. Color intensities had to be lowered, if it feels to dark
  for you now, increase the gamma correction value. [Bernd Wiebelt]

- Fixed sprite priorities and tile flip in Pinball Action. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Accurate colors in Road Fighter. [Paul Swan]

- Accurate colors in Slap Fight. [Keith Wilkins]

- Fixed Motos High Score display. [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Moon Cresta uses the original gfx ROMs, fixing graphics glitches on the title
  screen.


These drivers have improved SOUND:
----------------------------------

- Sound in Toki. [Nicola Salmoria]

- The YM3812 emulator still passes commands to the Sound Blaster OPL chip, but
  it handles timers in software. osd_ym3812_status and osd_ym3812_read removed.
  [Aaron Giles]

- Emulated sound in Yie Ar Kung Fu (but you still need samples for speech)
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Sound in Pinball Action. [Mirko Buffoni]

- Partial sound in Midnight Resistance and Sly Spy. [Bryan McPhail]

- Emulated music in Carnival, and support for a new set of samples.
  [Peter Clare]

- TMNT title music. [dayvee@rocketmail.com]


These drivers have HIGH SCORE support:
--------------------------------------

- Vastar. [Dani Portillo]

- Fixed Rygar (you'll have to delete your old .hi file) [Dani Portillo]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Fixed hangs in Tapper, and hopefully other MCR games as well. [Aaron Giles]

- Some fixes to Quantum. [Paul Forgey]

- The default scores in Paperboy and Super Sprint are correct (though of course
  you must delete the .HI files) [Aaron Giles]

- Super Qix might be running at the proper speed now. [Nicola Salmoria]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Close to accurate 68000 instruction timing. [Brian Verre]

- Slightly improved speed of the 68000 emulator. [Darren Olafson]

- The copyright disclaimer and driver credits screens are shown only the first
  time a game is run. The game information screen is always shown since it may
  contain important info.

- Improved handling of 4 way joysticks. [Martin Sandiford]

- [DOS] Modified the code so that to start a game you can use
  a) the full game name as listed in "mame -listfull"
  b) any ordered subset of the characters used in the full game name

  So you can start Asteroids Deluxe like:

  mame "Asteroids Deluxe"         !note the quotes!
  mame astdelx
  mame adlx

  The less characters you use, the more likely you'll be surprised which
  game actually gets choosen. [Bernd Wiebelt]

- [DOS] To improve comaptibility, older VESA modes are back. If your card
  doesn't work in VESA mode, try "vesamode=vesa2b" or "vesamode=vesa1" in
  mame.cfg [Bernd Wiebelt]

- [DOS] Slightly changed the resolution picker, so that when -vesa and
  -noscanlines are requested, it will use e.g. 320x240 instead of 640x480
  with pixel doubling, and 400x300 instead of 800x600 with pixel doubling.
  If the lower res mode is not available, it automatically switches back to
  the pixel doubled mode. [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] New -listclones command, which lists in two columns the clones and the
  game they are clone of. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Changed the AY8910 emulation to generate three separate audio streams for the
  three channels instead of premixing them. This improves audio quality,
  increases the volume, and doesn't seem to affect performance too much.
  [Nicola Salmoria]


Source:
-------

- [DOS] Included Neil Bradley's asm M6808 emulator. Note: you need NASM to
  compile (the makefile defaults to NASMW, the Win32 version). [Alex Pasadyn]

- The (*vh_update)() call has an additional parameter, full_refresh. When it
  is 0, the driver may assume that the screen has not been altered by the main
  engine since the last call, and do an incremental update instead of redrawing
  the full screen.  [Brad Oliver]

- For convenience, added some commonly used palette read/write fucntions to
  vidhrdw/generic.c. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Support for 16 bit samples in sndhrdw/samples.c.
  IMPORTANT NOTE FOR PORTERS: for consistency with the sound libraries,
  osd_play_sample_16() and osd_play_streamed_sample_16() now want the lenth in
  _bytes_ of the array, instead of the length in _shorts_ as it was before.
  [Peter Clare]

- Added the I8039 to the debugger, using Mike Cuddy's disassembler.
  [Andrea Mazzoleni]
