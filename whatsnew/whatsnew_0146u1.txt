--------------
- Naomi/Chihiro documentation update [f205v]

- seta.c: Added PCB layout & dipswitch locations for Magic Speed.
  [Brian Troha]

- Placed some handlers for the DM01 board into bfm_sc4 - once we can
  confirm more games are on the hardware, this can move into the main
  driver.  [James Wallace)

- CPS-1 update [Team CPS-1]:
  * Dumped and added CA22B.1A PAL to cawingj (Kold666)

- Hooked up inputs in DS Telejan [Angelo Salese]

  [Smitdogg, The Dumping Union]

  the interface hooks.  Cleaned up Scorpion 4 sets.  [David Haywood]

- z800x: Handle vectored interrupts correctly. [Christian Grössler]

- m72.c: Hooked up mcu to imgfightj. [David Haywood]

- 04862: smashtv and clones: Smash T.V. crashes while a game begins.
  [Phil Bennett]

  chdman) [Oliver Stöneberg]

- Added cycle exact potentiometer and keyboard support to pokey device
  [Couriersud].

- Fixed sprite colors in Bikkuri Card and Chance Kun
  [Smitdogg, Angelo Salese]

- megatech.c:  added a new revision of the bios [iGREKKESS, ElBarto]

- Added some bits to get the V53 (V33 core) running at least some sane
  sound code for hng64.c  There is no sound yet tho, and the banking
  mechanism will need hooking up but the initial banks should be
  correct.  [David Haywood]

- vsnes.c: Documentation update and corrects several roms names. Added
  set information to game names where possible. Tried to correction
  region information by copyright.
  [Mark F., Brian Troha, The Dumping Union]

- yiear.c: Correct rom labels [Smitdogg, The Dumping Union]

- flipjack.c: Documented dipswitch settings & pinout for Flipper Jack as
  per manual. [Brian Troha]

     hooked up. [hap]

- "Analog" Pokey Update [Couriersud]
  * Derived internal resistance calculation from Pokey documentation.
    This is a 4-bit parallel resistor (High-Z mos "devices") network
    to ground. The result is a non-linear resistance function.
  * Added low-pass filter support and opamp/resistor stages to the
    pokey driver. This is not as good as complete discrete emulation,
    but a lot better than the linear approximation we had before.
  * Changed a couple of drivers to use the new output volume
    calculation.
  * Added device configuration macros. Made all drivers use them.

- SDL: More OS/2 fixes [K.O. Myung-Hun]

  the Worlds (color) [wotwc].  Both display types now only need the one
  sample set (wotw).  [Tafoid]

    filtering)

     adapted to the new version. [Michael Zapf]

- Implemented buzzer sound in Destiny - The Fortuneteller [Angelo
  Salese]

- bzone.c: Add the Address Decode prom to Red Baron. Currently not used
  in emulation but we archive it anyways. [The Dumping Union]

- Improved clocks in bankp.c and gyruss.c [Corrado Tomaselli]

- Enable proper save stating for bfm_bd1 machine which should fix MT
  bug#03990 as well.  [James Wallace]

- naomi: Make illvelo boot, probably others too [O. Galibert]

- model2.c: Updated several sets with Sega's game and / or ROM board
  ID#. Corrected the sound CPU & sample roms for the Manx TT set (as
  verified by manual) and documented the undumped Manx TT Deluxe set.
