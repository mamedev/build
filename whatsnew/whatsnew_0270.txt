12620: nmk/ddealer.cpp: upgraded interrupts trigger system based on PROM contents [sergiopolog]
Same work done on this PR for **nmk/nmk16.cpp** driver:
https://github.com/mamedev/mame/pull/12562
is now applied in **nmk/ddealer.cpp**
Double Dealer uses the same "hires" screen resolution than several games in the nmk16 driver, and the same interrupt system based on
  PROM contents, so the same config is applied to it.
Pixel Clock was confirmed on real hw, too.

Each `cvdxyl_b` call in Atronic software seems to be clustered together with `vcol` and `vfill_l` opcodes which are not yet
  implemented.

12690: sony/news_r3k.cpp: Add support for the NWS-3720 [briceonk]
Tested both NEWS-OS 4 and 5 on all 3 drivers, each configuration is working. The desktop machines couldn't boot NEWS-OS 4 before
  because of the missing SCCVECT implementation (it would cause a bus error trying to use an expansion SCC, which obviously was not
  installed).
Also includes some naming cleanup, both of the source code and the BIOS files (to match the startup screen for each machine).
The ROM dump credit goes to Plamen :)

12723: MS68K: Marion Systems MS68K [eschaton]
The Marion Systems MS68K was a single-board 68000 system designed by Tom Oberheim in 1985 with a DUART providing two serial ports
  and (in combination with a latch) a parallel printer port, WD1772 floppy controller, optional NCR53C80 SCSI controller, and up to
  512KB of RAM and 128KB of ROM onboard. Also included is an expansion connector providing access to most of the 68000 bus as well
  as memory refresh signals and a single dedicated interrupt line.
The stock ROM is a monitor that also contains a port of Tiny BASIC 1.2 at 0xF04900 with a loader at 0xF04800. Thus while there is no
  direct monitor command to start it, a simple GF04800 will start Tiny BASIC (and as usual BYE will exit back to the monitor).
The monitor’s included floppy boot functionality will load the first sector of the disk to 0x800 and jump to it in supervisor mode.
  There is no SCSI boot functionality built in.
The MS68K was used in a number of college and university computer systems classes, and a variant of Peter Stark’s SK*DOS was
  available.

12727: floppy.cpp: Use standard drives for hard-sectored systems [mgarlanger]
Here is an alternate approach for handling hard-sectored floppy drives. Instead of requiring duplicating the existing drives and
  updating the variants, the sectoring is set during device configuration. This allows the drive to select the proper variants based
  on the sectoring type.

12743: igs_m027xa : copy the XA logic from igs_fear.cpp for now + use uploaded XOR tables [mamehaze]
note, this stops crzybugs booting for now, as it fails the XA check rather than passing it by chance.  I've done some
  experimentation and I think this needs irq mask / source / pending registers hooking up too, otherwise the ARM will keep writing
  commands to the XA when it doesn't want them
the comms structure otherwise seems the same (command structure is the same, the method of shifting in/out values seems the same
  etc.)
