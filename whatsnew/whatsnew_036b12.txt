0.36 BETA 12

To all people that submitted high score save updates: high score save is on
hold. No additions will be made for the time being. In the near future, high
score support will be removed from the executable to an external file, much
like the cheat.dat one. We are looking for a volunteer to maintain that file.


New games supported:
--------------------

HAL21 [Phil Stroffolino]
Pinbo [Scott Kelley]


New clones supported:
---------------------

Arch Rivals (revision 2)
Finalizer (bootleg)
Mad Gear (Japan)
Paint Roller (= Crush Roller)
Raiden (2 new sets)


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- 8039 in Finalizer. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed hanging music in Raiden. [Bryan McPhail]

- Fixed missing sounds in roishtar. [CAB]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Bypassed the protection in Exerion. [Zsolt Vasvari]

- The hangs in Tempest caused by the Pokey protection should now be fixed once
  and for all. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Fixed hangs in roishtar. [E. Watanabe, Takahiro Nogi]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] Artwork files can be stored in a .zip file. That way you can have eg.
  both spacewr1.png and spacewr2.png in one file spacewar.zip.
  [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Added the possibility to use a multiple keys or joysticks sequence to drive
  a generic action. This can be handy with consoles or cabinets with a limited
  number of buttons, to reuse all buttons with only one extra button, like a
  shift key. For example the COIN1 action can be mapped to the "Player 1 Fire"
  plus the "Extra Shift Button". It can also be used to map Q*Bert movements to
  joystick diagonals (since the orginal used a joystick rotate 45 degrees).
  [Andrea Mazzoleni]

- Added cpu overclocking control to the on screen display. [Juergen Buchmueller]


Source:
-------

- PORTERS BEWARE: the OS dependant code is now required to support a palettized
  16-bit display, where osd_modify_pen() can be called and the palette lookup
  is done during the final blit. A non palettized display can still optionally
  be used in special cases, see the comment about osd_allocate_colors() in
  osdepend.h. Also note that osd_allocate_colors() now can fail and returns a
  value; and the special case for 32768 pens has been removed, a valid palette
  is always passed to the function.

- Fixed OPN and OPM output level. Unfortunately this means that all games using
  YM2203, YM2151 etc. need to be rebalanced. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- Removed memory_region from struct MachineCPU, now this information is stored
  directly in the ROM list using the REGION_CPUx attributes.
  Also remember that now you must never use Machine->memory_region[], always
  use memory_region() (and the same for memory_region_length).
