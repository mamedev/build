- Some fixes to the System 16 games. [Phil Stroffolino]

- Fixed colors in Paperboy. [Aaron Giles]

- Some fiddling with the Atari vector games frame rates. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Slightly reduced the visible area of the Williams games, I'm not sure which
  would be the correct setting though. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Better colors in Red Alert. [Mike Balfour]


These drivers have improved SOUND:
----------------------------------

- Sped up music tempo in Gun Dealer.

- Wizard of Wor supports word samples. Only 30% of the needed samples are
  available, however. [Alex Judd]

- Fixed D-Day. [Zsolt Vasvari]


These drivers have HIGH SCORE support:
--------------------------------------

- Fixed Black Tiger, Bank Panic and The End. [Nicola Salmoria]

- World Cup '90 [Juan Carlos Lorente]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Support for the complete Curveball set. This also fixes the crash.

- Many improvements to the DECO games, especially Heavy Barrel. [Bryan McPhail]

- Sped up Route 16. [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Lots of clean up, consolidation, dip switches additions, color fixes to the
  Carnival driver (which is now called vicdual.c, since Carnival is just one of
  the many games which run on that hardware). [Marco Cassili]

- Slowed down a little the Sega raster games.

- You can assign a joystick button to the gear shift in Spy Hunter.

- Red Alert accepts coins. [Mike Balfour]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Increased the default gamma correction for the DOS version to 1.2. This will
  not have effect unless you change it in MAME.CFG (or just delete the file).

- Set back the default vgafreq to -1 (=auto). This is necessary for -vsync to
  pick the correct freq (most of the time) when used with tweaked VGA modes.
  This will not have effect unless you change it in MAME.CFG (or just delete
  the file).

- Fixed crash in -verifyroms which occurred in beta 3.

- Fixed -ror and -rol with ORIENTATION_SWAP_XY games (e.g. Kick) and
  ORIENTATION_FLIP_X games (e.g. Discs of Tron). [Nicola Salmoria]

- In the DOS version, -vsync is supported for games running at 57fps (e.g.
  Moon Patrol). However, due to the sync rate being different, the game
  runs 6% faster than it should. [Nicola Salmoria]


Source:
-------

- The DOS version is now compiled with GCC 2.8.1.

- T11 CPU emulator. This is used by the Atari System 2 drivers. [Aaron Giles]

- I8085 emulator. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- The 68000 memory handlers can again be word-aligned instead of
  longword-aligned. [Aaron Giles]

- Dynamic palette support for games with >256 colors, not complete yet but
  good for many cases. Drivers who want to use it must first of all set up like
  the static palette ones (put the real number of colors in MachineDriver->
  total_colors, etc.), and call palette_recalc() in vh_screenrefresh() before
  drawing anything. A color uage table must be passed to palette_recalc() so
  that the function knows which colors are needed.
  Drivers which use the new system, and therefore no longer run in 16-bit video
  modes: Black Tiger, City Connection, Gun Dealer, Ninja Gai Den.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Color PROMs no longer have to be included in the source. They can be loaded
  from disk just like the other ROMs. You just have to replace the color_prom
  pointer with the PROM_MEMORY_REGION() macro, to tell the core where the PROMs
  have been loaded. Example driver: Karnov/Chelnov. [Nicola Salmoria]
