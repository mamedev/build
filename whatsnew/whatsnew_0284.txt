13161: New working clone [Hydreigon223]
Hyperdrive (ver 1.31, Oct 21 1998) [Hydreigon]

13833: New Working Clone [Hydreigon223]
Gauntlet Legends (version 1.4)
Changed warfa and nbanfl to use the different bootroms as BIOS options (in the process, this removes set warfac since the only the
  bootrom differs from its parent set). I myself had to make changes in 2.7.u27 to reflect the changes made in its former
  driver_init so it could be used as a BIOS option.

14311: minitel2: Improved ROM list [fabio-d]
Different revisions of the Minitel 2 came with slightly different ROMs. In addition to the ones already listed (Bv4 and Bv9), this
  commits adds references to Bv6 and Bv7 too.
The descriptions of the ROMs were updated to mention "France Telecom" (the "ft_" in their names), who commissioned this Minitel
  model.
A placeholder "Custom ROM (for homebrew development)" was added too, with the maximum possible size (64 KiB). This makes it easy use
  precompiled MAME binaries to test/debug an homebrew ROM too, by simply copying it into the roms directory under the name
  "devel.bin" and then booting with "-bios devel".

14429: sharp/mz2000.cpp: Addition of mz2000_snap software list [paul75s]
Introduce mz2000_snap software list containing an initial 16 working snapshots for MZ-2000/MZ-2200.
These are all sourced from various TOSEC repositories, either in snapshot format (Binary Land and Flicky) or converted from MZT, WAV
  or D88 cassette tape/floppy disk images which are currently unsupported in MAME, using DumpListEditor to extract the binaries.
Everything included is supported in this format. Proposed guidelines for what should be included here (vs using original cassette
  tape or floppy disk formats in existing software lists) included in the xml file.

14550: rendlay.cpp: Improve accuracy and performance calculating text aspect ratio. [cbrunschen]
Also adds another text alignment option to stretch the text to fill its bounds horizontally.
The current code calculating the aspect ratio for text involves looping, calculating the width of text for a variety of decreasing
  aspect ratios until the text's width is less than the available bounds. However, this string width calculation performs the same
  loop over the text each time, finally multiplying by the candidate aspect ratio. That text width calculation thus really only
  needs to be done once. Further, instead of trying different aspect ratios, the ratio can simply be calculated directly by dividing
  the width of the bounds by the string's width. This also calculates a more accurate aspect ratio, rather than always resulting in
  an aspect ratio of (0.95)^n.
For example, when trying to fit a 101-pixel wide text into a 100-pixel wide space, the current code would result in an aspect ratio
  of 0.95, making the text 96 pixels wide,  leaving 4 pixels unused;  the new code will instead calculate the aspect ratio as
  100/101 == 0.9900990099... , making the text use the full 100 available pixels.
This in turn allows us to easily calculate the ratio also if we want to not just schrink but also stretch the text to fill the
  available space, so we add that as another text alignment option, number 3 (three).
This PR also demonstrates this in the VFX family of layouts, where on the default Full view, the text "MUSIC PRODUCTION SYNTHESIZER"
  ("DYNAMIC COMPONENT SYNTHESIZER" on the VFX), the logo-like text "ensoniq", and the keyboard-specific markers "VFX", "VFX-SD",
  "SD-1" and "3 2 V O I C E" can now be made to fill their available space horizontally as they should, making it all look that much
  more like the real thing. One example from the sd132, before:
<img width="282" height="292" alt="Screenshot From 2025-11-19 16-34-01"
  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/995d262b-2f1f-405a-b385-29b4aa495c75" />
after:
<img width="282" height="292" alt="Screenshot From 2025-11-19 16-33-18"
  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cddfc0e-8267-4025-ba6b-d4e959e1b500" />
 
and the real thing:
<img width="282" height="292" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da00308d-b356-4bfd-85b0-7be99e7f8b9a" />
While still not perfect, the "after" at least has the corrects widths and horizontal alignments.

14554: apple2e: fix FLASH timing [arekkusu42]
This commit fixes the FLASH timing for IIe, IIc, IIgs.
apple2 uses a 555 timer @ ~2.182 Hz (Sather UTA2 8.6, 8.7) which alternates every ~15 frames.
apple2e and later do not have this 555 timer on the motherboard. Sather postulates that they instead use IOU video counter overflow
  (UTA2E fig 3.8), which alternates exactly every 16 frames (regardless of NTSC/PAL.)
Testing:
New FLASHHZ unit test, which shows a (_possibly seizure-inducing_) pattern of columns blinking at decreasing rates, to align with
  real FLASH text:
<img width="560" height="384" alt="FLASHHZ_apple2p"
  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a1ad672-3f05-447b-ae09-b75170246ff1" />
FLASHHZ_251119.zip
The test is beam-racing the flashing columns via vaporlock (or VBL on the IIgs) and is NTSC/PAL compatible.  The (D) key delays the
  blinking one frame, so you can manually align the phase of column G (or column F on the ][+).
After this PR, MAME now matches the behavior of a real Apple IIe:
(_blinky video, photosensitive epilepsy warning_)
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74eda815-0188-4730-a140-55bed6d2bb2b
A real IIgs also matches this.  The IIgs can dynamically toggle between 60/50Hz, where we can see that the 50Hz display also flashes
  exactly every 16 frames:
(_even more blinky video_)
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e2791b0-69bd-4abc-b3c8-d7a88af3733b
TODO:
After #14495, apple2gs now has stable beam-racing in this test, however LANGSEL doesn't implement 50Hz in MAME yet.  I have that
  working in another WIP PR, but there are entanglements with C02E and floating bus readback which need more testing.

14562: {vfx,vfxsd,sd1,sd132}.lay: Many cosmetic updates. Show floppy and/or cartridge if loaded. [cbrunschen]
VFX family buttons are actually 15.8mm wide, not 15mm. Regenerated all four layouts.
Before:
<img width="3500" height="796" alt="Screenshot From 2025-11-21 14-48-03"
  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d0d32ab-7916-412e-ac05-a61d98191b92" />
Real VFX-SD:
<img width="3815" height="718" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6196f70b-66b1-4148-a0a6-99e0beb971eb" />
After:
<img width="3500" height="794" alt="Screenshot From 2025-11-21 14-47-26"
  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c41bfee-1e49-4db7-b13c-c36d70769a19" />
The difference is quite small, especially if you look at the groups of buttons on the right side of the panel.
But if you look at the space between the **Seq** and **0** buttons below the screen, the "After" picture looks a lot more like the
  real VFX-SD than the "Before" picture.

14564: xavix.cpp (audio tweaks, fix regression in rad_mtrk) [mamehaze]
xavix.cpp (audio improvements) [ramacat]
 - remove the udance hack, it was stopping rad_mtrk going in game, and with the sample mode disabled elsewhere udance does't play

14577: att6300p.cpp: Add support for 1.2MB drive (525hd) [donohoe00]
The standard configurations for the 6300 Plus have drive A as a 1.2MB floppy, with either a hard drive or a 360K floppy as a
  secondary drive.  One thing that's unique to the 6300 Plus is that port 0x65 is used for data rate control.
Since the FDC is on the motherboard, isa8_fdc_6300p_device is unique to the 6300 Plus... I'm wondering if it should go in a
  machine-specific file, instead of in fdc.cpp?

<img width="681" height="386" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e485ef71-aec5-48c3-ae23-40b0164f51e7" />

14590: apple2: minor video fixes [arekkusu42]
This PR collects a few minor video fixes (separated from a larger 50Hz WIP PR):
* apple2: read floating bus before video side-effects
Hardware actually latches video state 1-3 cycles after touching a softswitch; this commit does not implement that, but now it will
  appear as if the state is latched 0.5 cycles after, which is at least closer to being correct.
This applies to `apple2/e/gs`, common clones, `tk2000` (for its singular softswitch), and `superga2` (where it is a no-op because
  floating bus is hardcoded to 0xFF.)  I did not propagate it to `laser3k` (which inlines 0xFF) or `agat` (which notes the video
  hardware is different.)
My previous SWITCHES test now shows the C05X row matching hardware:
<img width="560" height="384" alt="apple2ee_switches"
  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1f8f51f-c36c-41a2-9cc9-4e8480f4413a" />
This also fixes this test by Ryandesign (who notes this is a common problem across various emulators), from "`7F   7F`" to "`A0
  7F`".
<br>
* apple2video: improve beam-racing
My previous VIDSYNC test (which is updated here with 50Hz support) now shows beam-raced MouseText in MAME.
Also, a new LANGSEL unit test shows beam-raced MouseText on apple2ee:
<img width="560" height="384" alt="apple2ee_langsel"
  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e10242af-5398-4d3c-8670-5ed42482767d" />
...and beam-raced katakana on apple2jp:
<img width="560" height="384" alt="apple2jp_langsel"
  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/589327c8-5faf-4882-a571-2cdfd044eae1" />
...and MouseText plus eight languages simultaneously on a real Apple IIgs:
!HW2gs_LANGSEL_50Hz
LANGSEL_251126.zip
(_note_: currently, MAME must be running at 1 MHz for floating bus timing to work.  Also on apple2gs, whole-scanline partial updates
  work for MouseText, but more complex intra-scanline updates don't work, so the bottom two rows only show the last value latched--
  all Danish or Swedish.)
The Apple IIgs Firmware Reference states that LANGSEL bit 3 is "0 if primary lang set selected", but this appears to be incorrect.
  Bit 3 is set to 1 by BRAM restore during power-on (or booting GS/OS, or entering the Control Panel) and hardware testing shows
  that the language in bits 5-7 is ignored when bit 3 is 0.
The `apple2video` state setters now more consistently avoid unnecessary partial updates.  Eyeballing the F11 stats across a bunch of
  games and beam-racing demos, it is difficult to find any user-visible difference.  However extra instrumentation to detect
  redundant state setting shows that there were indeed occasional needless partial updates, when booting ProDOS, starting games,
  etc.  A contrived example like `300:LDA $C052, JMP $300` clearly shows the difference.
<br>
* apple2gs: fix vertical position of 8-bit modes
Previously, MAME was centering the 8-bit modes, so the top and bottom borders each grew by 4 scanlines when toggling from SHR.  It
  is easy to see this is wrong, if you set the border color to something different from the text background color, and toggle from

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11234dcf-5814-4d70-a660-d213e7da5cba
(athough the 8-bit 14MHz modes are still horizontally squished inside the 16MHz framebuffer...)

14592: sega/model2: Various improvements [gm-matthew]
- I have moved `geo_parse()` and the frame number update to the start of vblank; this fixes high score scrolling in `segawski`, 2D
  palette in `dynamcopc`, and 3D graphics in `bel` not displaying after first booting up.
- Z-Sort mode value uses an exponent point to adjust the z-value scale. Without adjustment, some of the background objects in
  `srallyc` exceed the maximum exponent and so are not displayed properly.
- I have merged `model2_3d_process_quad()` and `model2_3d_process_triangle()` into a single template function, since most of the
  code was identical.
- Original Model 2 does have FIFO control; it uses the same 315-5673 buffer controller as Model 2A and 2C.
- Burst stall must be cleared when resetting the i960, otherwise games can potentially hang on soft reset.

14596: nec/pc6001.cpp: Add cassette software lists [paul75s]
2nd attempt - enables 2 new software lists:
pc6001_cass, supporting all PC-6001 models (with 16 initial working software items)
pc6001mk2_cass, supporting PC-6001mkII, PC-6001mkIISR and PC-6601 (with 18 initial working items)
Approach of separate software lists, with each treated as original is consistent with approach for pc8001 and seems appropriate due
  to PC-6001 software being fully supported on later versions, and PC-6001 software often having mkII modes.
In line with the current hack to enable cassette based software, items are configured as carts, not cassettes.
All software items sourced from TOSEC repositories.
Revisions from initial attempt at this:
- All items flagged as partially supported. This seems appropriate based on the software largely/fully functioning but requiring the
  current hacks to support cassette based software. Happy to modify to not supported though if this seems more accurate.
- Fixed missing tag in pc6001_cass.
- Corrected a couple of game names and also amended/enhanced some metadata, including addition of alternate Japanese titles where I
  can find these.
Where included files are in .p6 format, these are working (along with .cas files).

14632: i86.cpp: Need different EA execution times per CPU variant (808x/80186/80286) [donohoe00]
The 286 is running a lot slower than it should since it's being "billed" for effective address calculations at 808x rates.  A
  benchmark I ran on att6300p (https://thandor.net/benchmark/36) shows a score increase from 29 to 46 with this change applied.
I discovered this issue because one of the tests on the 6300 Plus diagnostics disk was failing, since the test was taking longer
  than expected.  There's a possibility that the POST on some machines could fail in a similar way.

14636: sega/model2.cpp: make hpyagu98 playable [gm-matthew]
`hpyagu98` requires certain values to be set in EEPROM and backup RAM, otherwise it fails to boot with "Error 1":
- The values `0xfa`, `0xe3`, `0xa6` and `0x29` at addresses `0x08`, `0x09`, `0x0a` and `0x0b` respectively in the EEPROM
- The string `"98KOREA PRO B.B."` at the start of backup RAM
- The 32-bit magic number `0x5042c660` at address `0x398` in backup RAM
- A 16-bit checksum at address `0x1d4` in backup RAM; with backup RAM set to default and only the above values modified, this
  checksum is `0xf92f`
With the above values set the game successfully boots, but the game/coin options are invalid; in my testing I was able to play
  through a full game, but the game crashed shortly after returning to attract mode.
The game/coin options can easily be set to valid options in the service menu; my current commit uses an EEPROM and backup RAM from
  just after setting the game/coin options to match the defaults for `dynabb97` and clearing the backup RAM data in the service
  menu. After doing this, the game appears to be stable.
I shall send the EEPROM and backup RAM used in this commit to the email address listed in this page. If there is anywhere else I
  should send these, let me know.
I have swapped the texture ROMs as they were the wrong way round; for now I have left their names intact, but we may want to rename
  them to `bb-tx-1.25` and `bb-tx-0.24` to reflect their actual IC numbers.

14640: ibm5170: Mark Crystal Caves as a baddump; fix grdchessdx media type [chungy]

  older versions of MAME but not on current versions and should not require additional RAM).
- All items in m5_cass updated with requirement for BASIC-I or BASIC-G cart, as appropriate.
- Some minor additional tweaks to metadata.
All files are from dumps provided by bsittler.

14645: sega/model2.cpp: when writing to IRQ mask register, wait two cycles before checking for sound IRQ; fixes MT09313 [gm-matthew]
Virtua Cop 2 runs the following code when playing a music track or some sound effects:
```
0005A524: 90803000 005D05FC ld      0x5d05fc,g0			; load sound buffer queue size
0005A52C: 5CB01E01          mov     1,g6

0005A558: 58A5088F          and     15,g4,g4
0005A55C: 92203915 005D0610 st      r4,0x5d0610[g5*4]
0005A564: 92A03000 005D0600 st      g4,0x5d0600
0005A56C: 8CB00401          lda     0x401,g6
0005A570: 92B03000 00E80004 st      g6,0xe80004			; unmask sound IRQ
0005A578: 92803000 005D05FC st      g0,0x5d05fc			; save sound buffer queue size
0005A580: 92B03000 00E80004 st      g6,0xe80004
```
During the sound interrupt handler, the game checks the sound buffer queue size. If it is greater than zero, it reads the next byte
  from the sound buffer queue, transmits it to the SCSP and decrements the queue size by one; if it is zero (queue is empty), it
  bails.
MT09313 is caused by MAME asserting a sound interrupt the instant it is unmasked, before the game has a chance to save the
  incremented queue size. The sound interrupt handler reads the queue size, mistakenly thinks that the queue is empty and does not
  transmit the data to the SCSP, resulting in sound effects and/or music tracks not playing. This occurs since commit
  99f8b5e05cc0f983a5d52f3e2bae46358e1ef789 when I rewrote the interrupt logic.
It seems there must be a slight delay between unmasking an interrupt and the same interrupt being fired; the exact delay is unknown,
  but it only needs to be enough for the following `st g0,0x5d05fc` instruction to be executed before the sound interrupt is
  asserted.
I have implemented it so that when writing to the IRQ mask register, instead of immediately checking to see if a sound interrupt
  should be asserted, we use a timer to wait for two cycles before doing so (the `st` instruction requires two cycles to execute).

14649: ibm5170: add Doom 2 Germany release [chungy]
This is not sourced from original media.  I had copies of the files on my hard disk, and while it matches known-good checksums (eg:
  https://doomwiki.org/wiki/DOOM2.WAD), I had to reconstruct the floppy set myself.  The set was created by running msdos622 in the
  ct486 driver with a CD-ROM attached.  I put the loose files on an ISO image, mounted it in the DOS machine, and then formatted
  floppies and copied the files to them just as the normal Doom installation sets work.
Due to this nature, I am marking this as a “bad dump” in the hopes someone may be able to find and dump the original disks.

14661: goldstar.cpp: Add conditional DIP for payout rate / difficulty display (DSW1) [jbtx77gr]
Implemented conditional DIP switch behavior for DSW1 based on DSW4:2. When "Show In Confirm Screen" (DSW4:2) is set to Percentage,
  DSW1 now displays payout rate values (55%–90%). When set to Level of Difficulty, DSW1 instead displays levels (1–8). Both sets of
  options use the same bitmask (0x07) and are filtered through PORT_CONDITION to match the hardware behavior.

14669: starwars, esb: settings corrected and defaults now match the operator's manuals [codefrog2002]
starwars: default settings now match the arcade operator's manual (starting shields: 6, difficulty: Hard).
esb: settings corrected - Difficulty and Demo Sounds can't be inherited from starwars as they are scrambled/inverted relative to
  starwars. Difficulty default ("Hard") taken from ESB Conversion Kit manual.
The updated ESB settings can be validated in the 2nd screen ("Game Options") of the service menu. Note that DSW changes aren't
  immediately displayed - the menu shows the state of EEPROM settings only.
On the "Game Options" screen, move down to "Reset Options" then left-fire to opt for YES, then right-fire to perform the options
  reset; this latches current DSW settings into EEPROM.
The default settings cannot be verified in emulation alone - they are now as reported in these documents:

  last that has good functionality within MAME itself.
While version 2002 dropped Windows 95 support, it still includes many DOS programs that run all the way back to MS-DOS 5.0.  Notably
  the DiskEdit program supports FAT32, VFAT, and all that allows some forensics to be done to determine good/bad dumps.

14677: New Machine - Head On 2 (Sega Slimline)/Head On Part 2 (Nintendo) [SNESNESCUBE64]
This new machine is the vertically oriented version of head on 2. As far as I can tell this was found in the Sega Slimline cabinets
  (which is where the dump from this came from) and a single example of a Nintendo Head On Part 2 machine. The Nintendo one was
  particularly interesting because it ran on stock Head On N hardware. The only noticeable difference I observed with it running on
  Head On N hardware is that it cannot have six lives. This is because despite having 8 dip switch switches, only one is actually
  hooked up on the PCB. This is acknowledged by the instruction card in the machine as the only options are 4 and 5 lives.
  Otherwise, it plays like a hybrid of Head On N and Head On 2. It is meant to only be played on cocktail tables, the screen
  flipping is hard coded.
The only effected MAME driver is the vicdual driver. The machine config had to be added to the public header and the bare minimum
  had to be added to the vicdual source file (machine config, rom config, and input ports). I did both a full build and vicdual
  focused build, it does not seem like any additional compiler warnings were added. The game plays in MAME just like it does on a
  real machine with the exception being the dot sound (which does not seem to be full implemented). The best way I can describe the
  dot sound is it sounds like a quick pulse of the bonus sound. This is a per-existing condition though.
Regarding the ROMs, the actual program ROMs are unique. However, the timing PROMs are the same as Head On.

14680: sound/cem3394.cpp: implement self-oscillation when no waveforms are enabled [m1macrophage]
Detecting the special case of a filter with high resonance and no input waveforms, and generating a sine wave to implement
  self-oscillation.
Fixes the regression reporter here. Also fixes patches 98 and 99 on the `sixtrak`, and enables ever more sounds in `sente6vb` .
Finally, corrected the value of `m_pulse_width` when PW is at 100%.  Though this does not make a difference, since `m_pulse_width`
  is not used when the PW is 100%.

    decreasing aspect ratios until the text's width is less than the available bounds. However, this string width calculation
    performs the same loop over the text each time, finally multiplying by the candidate aspect ratio. That text width calculation
    thus really only needs to be done once. Further, instead of trying different aspect ratios, the ratio can simply be calculated
    directly by dividing the width of the bounds by the string's width. This also calculates a more accurate aspect ratio, rather
    than always resulting in an aspect ratio of (0.95)^n.
 * For example, when trying to fit a 101-pixel wide text into a 100-pixel wide space, the current code would result in an aspect
    ratio of 0.95, making the text 96 pixels wide,  leaving 4 pixels unused;  the new code will instead calculate the aspect ratio
    as 100/101 == 0.9900990099... , making the text use the full 100 available pixels.
 * This in turn allows us to easily calculate the ratio also if we want to not just schrink but also stretch the text to fill the
    available space, so we add that as another text alignment option, number 3 (three).
 * This PR also demonstrates this in the VFX family of layouts, where on the default Full view, the text "MUSIC PRODUCTION
    SYNTHESIZER" ("DYNAMIC COMPONENT SYNTHESIZER" on the VFX), the logo-like text "ensoniq", and the keyboard-specific markers
    "VFX", "VFX-SD", "SD-1" and "3 2 V O I C E" can now be made to fill their available space horizontally as they should, making it
    all look that much more like the real thing.

-rendlay: guard against possible divide by 0 [hap]

-formats/fsblk.cpp: Internal API change [AJR]
 * Raw pointer accessors (data, rodata) are no longer provided for fsblk_t::block_t. Other accessors used to be based on these
    methods, but now require their own internal overrides. This entails more copying of data in many cases, but will allow more
    flexible subclassing opportunities in the future.
 * To compensate for the removal of raw pointer accessors, add methods to fsblk_t::block_t for checking whether a portion of a block
    is equal to a memory range or a string (eqmem, eqstr). The resulting changed behavior in formats/fs_oric_jasmin.cpp actually
    fixes a bug in the directory search routine.

-sega/model2.cpp, sega/model2_v.cpp: Various improvements: (#14592) [Matthew Daniels]
 * Moved geo_parse() and frame number update to start of vertical blanking (fixes high score scrolling in segawski, 2D palette in
    dynamcopc, and 3D graphics in bel not displaying after first booting up).
 * Use exponent to adjust the Z-value scale for Z-sorting.
 * Merged model2_3d_process_quad() and model2_3d_process_triangle() into a single template function, since most of the code was
    identical.
 * Original Model 2 does have FIFO control; it uses the same 315-5673 buffer controller as Model 2A and 2C.
 * Replaced scanline timer with vertical blanking callback.

    On the 8088/8086 on the other hand, it can take up to 12 cycles.  There needs to be a different set of timings for each CPU

-goldstar.cpp: Added nfb96 conditional DIP switches for payout rate / difficulty display (DSW1) (#14661) [Ioannis Bampoulas]
 * Implemented conditional nfb96 DIP switches behavior for DSW1 based on DSW4:2. When "Show In Confirm Screen" (DSW4:2) is set to
    Percentage, DSW1 now displays payout rate values (55%–90%). When set to Level of Difficulty, DSW1 instead displays levels (1–8).
    Both sets of options use the same bitmask (0x07) and are filtered through PORT_CONDITION to match the hardware behavior.

-starwars: difficulty settings now match the arcade operator's manual (starting shields: 6, difficulty: Hard). (#14669)
 [codefrog2002]
 * esb: settings corrected - Difficulty and Demo Sounds can't be inherited from starwars as they are scrambled/inverted relative to
    starwars. Difficulty default ("Hard") taken from ESB Conversion Kit manual.
 * Co-authored-by: Daniel Filner <cybermat@tilekiller.com>

-Current Plug & Play PR - ELAN SoC refactoring pass 2 (#14648) [mamehaze]

Family Tetris (PAL) [Team Europe]

-ibm5170: add Doom 2 Germany release (#14649) [Mike Swanson]
 * This is not sourced from original media.  I had copies of the files on my hard disk, and while it matches known-good checksums
    (eg: https://doomwiki.org/wiki/DOOM2.WAD), I had to reconstruct the floppy set myself.  The set was created by running msdos622
    in the ct486 driver with a CD-ROM attached.  I put the loose files on an ISO image, mounted it in the DOS machine, and then
    formatted floppies and copied the files to them just as the normal Doom installation sets work.
 * Due to this nature, I am marking this as a “bad dump” in the hopes someone may be able to find and dump the original disks.

-ibm5150, ibm5170, ibm5170_cdrom: Add Norton Utilities 1983–2002 (#14671) [Mike Swanson]
 * This covers basically the entire original run of the Norton Utilities as a standalone product.  Version 2002 is also pretty much
    the last that has good functionality within MAME itself.
 * While version 2002 dropped Windows 95 support, it still includes many DOS programs that run all the way back to MS-DOS 5.0.
    Notably the DiskEdit program supports FAT32, VFAT, and all that allows some forensics to be done to determine good/bad dumps.
