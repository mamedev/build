         first hole. (Angelo Salese)

Source Changes

Added screen raw params and irq ack to the dec0 driver, fixing hole 1
hang in Birdie Try and improving fade in/out effects for Boulder Dash
[Angelo Salese]

Funworld driver updates: [Roberto Fresca]
 * Complete support for Witch Royal, from Video Klein.
 * Reworked the button-lamps layout to get the hold buttons more
    centered.

Eliminates the extern variables from atarimo video core, in order to
remove a significant source of AM_BASE macros. [Atari Ace]

Converted astrocde/kaneko16/namcos23/suprnova to driver_device
[Atari Ace]

Converted Taito F3 video chip (TC0630FDP) to have a parallelism of
16-bit [Angelo Salese]

Converted 2 Minutes Drill driver to use Taito F3 video chip, this
hugely improves graphics in it [Angelo Salese]

Added irq ack and fixed sound chip type to be YM2610B for 2 Minutes
Drill [Angelo Salese]

Dumped the DVD image for bikiniko [alien_mame, The Dumping Union]

Added work-around for crowd gfxs in Taito F3 football games (Taito Cup
Finals, International Cup '94, Taito Power Goal and clones), until a
better information is found about it [David Haywood]

softlist: moved software list handling (in the Internal UI) to a
separate source, and made the code more similar to the File Manager
handling code. [Fabio Priuli]

CPS-3 update [Team CPS-1]:
 * Added Street Fighter III: New Generation Hispanic BIOS rom CD
    version
 * Added a detailed table of all known releases until now with usefull
    notes to identify new Cart Regions/CD Revisions
 * Renamed some CHDs to use the new Catalog # standard

uiswlist.c: added a switch to choose between shortname order or
description order for softlist entries (in the Internal UI), and
adapted the char input code to match shortnames or descriptions
accordingly [Fabio Priuli]

sc61860 cpu - fix for crash and cleanup, replace for internal ram
accesses with function calls to help further debug the core in the
future [Atari Ace]

cartslot.c/chd_cd.c: added support for a callback function to test
softlist sharedfeat (e.g. 'compatibility') and display a warning
message accordingly. updated cdi.c as an example [Fabio Priuli]

Decrypted 3 Super 8 program ROM [Lord Nightmare, Kevtris]

cassette.c/flopdrv.c: added support for a display info callback
function [Miodrag Milanovic]

corona/galaxian/namcos21/namcos22/namcos23/psikyosh/quizo/sigmab98 to
driver_device.  [Atari Ace]

Convert scramble/galaxold to driver_device  [Atari Ace]

Audio device additions:  [Atari Ace]
 * exidy440/m72/segasnd are converted to legacy devices.
 * cage/dcs/williams variables are restructured internally to resemble
    a device, simplifying a future device conversion.  Some AM_BASE
    macros are eliminated as well.
 * taito_en has minor changes to eliminate an AM_BASE macro.

Heavily improved 3 Super 8 emulation, and implemented NMI acknowledge
mechanism into the Super Poker driver [Angelo Salese]

i286 - Fixed protected mode boundary check [Miodrag Milanovic]

naomibd: Fix collision with system macro on NetBSD [Thomas Klausner]

Implemented PAL-like prom read-back in 4 En Raya [Angelo Salese]

Fixed Pururun's audio pitch/speed to match that of a reference video. 
[Tafoid]

tms5220.c: updates to comments and nonstandard feature defines.
[Lord Nightmare]

8237dma - Added cascade mode support [Wilbert Pol]

pic8259 - Added support for cascade mode, updated interface in all
drivers [Miodrag Milanovic]

upd7725.c: Implementation of the p0 and p1 output bits as device
lines; preliminary implementation of INT input line. [Lord Nightmare]

Replaced mamedriv.c with a new driver list mechanism that is generated
by the build tools. The emulator core now expects the presence of a
file called src/$(TARGET)/$(SUBTARGET).lst which is just a raw list of
driver names, one per line. C and C++ comments are still permitted.
This file is parsed by a new build tool makelist which extracts the
driver names, sorts them, and generates a file called drivlist.c,
which is consumed by the core. [Aaron Giles]

Added new osdcore function osd_malloc_array() which is identical to
osd_malloc() but obviously hints that the underlying allocation is for
an array. Updated all callers to use the appropriate form. Modified
the Windows allocator to only use guard pages for array-style
allocations, allowing us to enable them once again in debug builds.
[Aaron Giles]

Created new static class driver_list to wrap accesses to the list of
available drivers. Improved speed of driver lookups by relying on the
presorting done by makelist. [Aaron Giles]

Created helper class driver_enumerator as a helper for iterating
through the list of drivers. This class supports basic filtering and
iteration, and also serves as a temporary cache of machine_configs.
[Aaron Giles]

Created cli_frontend object to wrap all the CLI handling code in
clifront.c. Updated/simplified all the code to take advantage of the
driver_enumerator. [Aaron Giles]

Created media_auditor object to wrap all the auditing functions in
audit.c. Updated all users to the new interface. Note that the new
auditing mechanism is slightly out of sync with the romload code in
terms of finding ROMs owned by devices, so it may mis-report some
issues until the new ROM loading code is in. [Aaron Giles]

Added concept of a per-device searchpath. For most devices, their
searchpath is just the short name of the device. For driver_devices,
the searchpath is driver[;parent[;bios]]. This searchpath will
eventually be used by the rom loader to find ROMs. For now it is used
by the media auditor only. [Aaron Giles]

Created info_xml_creator object to wrap all the info generation
functions in info.c. Converted the file to C++ and cleaned up the
input processing code. [Aaron Giles]

model2.c: Corrected the revision level for Top Skater (USA) set
[The Dumping Union]

Various improvements to the Konami Viper driver [Ville Linde]

midqslvr: Add some hardware information [O. Galibert]

Added reverse-spin support to the stepper motor simulator
[James Wallace]

mpu4.c: Documented MOD 4 OKI program card ROM banking and improved the
BwB characteriser emulation. [James Wallace]

Fixed the I/O address in Intel 8257 DMA operations. [Curt Coder]

Fixes for non-native SDL builds on OS X [Paulo Cabral]

Added "Mandatory artwork is missing" error [Oliver Stöneberg]

Implemented 16-bit device callbacks. [Curt Coder]

Fix loading fonts on MacOSX. [Couriersud]

Delegates 2.0 implementation. Resdesigned how delegates work to make
them more flexible and simpler to use. Got rid of the proto_delegates
altogether in favor of supporting delegates that are bound to NULL
objects. Added a front-end template that supports "natural" syntax
favored by libraries like boost. Added support for static functions
that take reference parameters instead of pointer parameters for the
object type. Updated all delegate users in the system to the new
syntax. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the DIRECT_UPDATE_HANDLER to take a machine reference like
everything else in the system. Updated all users. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the FUNC() macro to automatically put an & in front of the
item passed. In general this works transparently, however it does have
the nice side-effect of catching situations where a variable is passed
instead of a function name. Fixed those cases to push the naming
upstream so that the name is now provided properly. Also added a
FUNC_NULL macro since FUNC(NULL) no longer works. [Aaron Giles]

tms5220.c: partially fixed perfect interpolation hack, disabled by
default. [Lord Nightmare]

segas24: Start untangling the Vogon poetry Atari Ace left is his wake.
Apply the new timing implementation per cgfm's analysis. Gain ground
is going to be stuck in free play mode. [O. Galibert]

tms5220.c: fixed perfect interpolation hack the rest of the way, now
it works as it did before 0.140 or so. [Lord Nightmare]

tms5220.c: improve perfect interpolation hack slightly, should be less
noisy after inhibit frames. [Lord Nightmare]
