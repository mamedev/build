Source Changes
--------------
-tms5110r.c: Verified TMS5200 LPC rom as correct from decap.
 [digshadow, Lord Nightmare]

-tms5110r.c: Corrected and verified TMS5100 LPC table against the
 decap. [digshadow, Lord Nightmare]

-tms5220.c: updated many comments, changed a variable name, and made
 some minor fixes to the 'circuit 412' to better reflect the patent.
 [Lord Nightmare]

-m6502: Undocumented instruction 0x80 is a 2-byte nop, not a 1-byte one
 [O. Galibert]

-SDL: Fix symlink handling by internal file manager. [qmc2]

-naomi: Redumped GD-ROMs for cvs2gd, senkoo, and ss2005. [f205v]

-braveff: Added dump of mask ROMs [Guru, R. Belmont]

-netlist.h: Fix for GCC prior to 4.3 [Federico Schwindt]

-naomi: GD-ROM redumps for confmiss, sprtjam, vstrik3, dygolf [f205v]

-Adds simple_set data structure and hooked it up to the debugger
 comment system. [Andrew Gardner]

-naomi: Redumped mok, shaktamb, vtennis2, ngdup23a, vf4evo, initdexp,
 initdv3j, senkosp and initdv3e. [f205v]

-hikaru: Redumped bad ROMs in braveff and sgnascar as per the test mode
 checksum tables. [Guru]

-suna16.c: Added board documentation, added PCB layouts for both styles
 of Back Street Soccer and Ultra Balloon. Added dipswitch locations to
 Back Street Soccer, Ultra Balloon and Best of Best. Changed CPU clocks
 to actual OSC based timing. [Brian Troha]

-tms5220.c: Based on decap analysis, both the TMS5220 and TMS5220C use
 identical LPC tables; get rid of the unnecessary extra table.
 [Lord Nightmare, digshadow]

-PSX GTE: Improved FLAG calculation in NCDS, CDP, NCDT, NCCS, CC, NCS, 
 NCT & NCCT by checking for overflow after each addition. [smf]

-Detailed differences in Fighting Golf (US) from parent based on
 observation and "SNK Program Update" notice which was found which
 includes a DIPSWITCH change.  [Tafoid, Shane Chaneman]

-Correct bit for POK_KEY_BREAK which now allows colon/semi-colon [:;]
 key to work properly  [Tom Clayton]

-primrag2: PCB readme shows 8MB RAM, make it so. [R. Belmont]

-fixed MVMVA flag calculation & replicate the bugs when mx is set to 3
 or cv is set to 2. [smf]

-esripsys.c - Fix regression caused by cycle-exact 6809 core
 [Phil Bennett]

-PSX GTE: fixed RTPS flags and calculation [smf]

-QT Debugger: Adds trackpc command, allowing for a visual display of
 where the program counter has visited in the dasm windows. Run "help
 trackpc" in the debugger to see the options. [Andrew Gardner]

-PSX GTE: fixed RTPT flags calculation & added a new divide implementation that
 uses a much smaller table [smf]

-Partial support for 1f801060 for setting the RAM size, if the size is
 set larger than the actual memory then RAM is repeated. As a result
 the RAM is no longer included in the drivers memory map, you have to
 specify the size in the machine. [smf]

-Fruit: fix VGA BIOS mirror, RAM amount, and HDD writability
 [Carl, R. Belmont]

-superchs.c: Corrected main CPU clock, corrected some rom labels. Added 
 plds to the Super Chase - Criminal Termination sets. [Porchy, 
 Brian Troha, The Dumping Union]

-6850acia.c: Improved DCD signal handling.  [Wilbert Pol]

-arcadia.c: Added the SEC-SCPA pal dump used on Magic Johnson's Fast
 Break and Leader Board. [Kevin Eshbach]

-PSX CPU creates a ram device, this has exposed a problem with not
 removing the child devices from the hash map when removing replacing
 devices. At the moment I have changed device.c so that when any device
 is removed the hash maps are reset. [smf]

-segas18.c: added ddcrewj 317-0185 decryption key
 [Porchy, Charles MacDonald]

-QT Debugger: Now saves all settings for all open windows - including
 docks in the main debug window. Also fixes bug where closing the main
 window with the X in the corner didn't save settings properly. 
 [Andrew Gardner]

-taitotz.c: added romdumps from pwrshovl additional I/O PCB [Tormod]

-iteagle: Updated documentation [Guru, Brian Troha]

-OS X: Support for both OS X native and Unix-style multiuser installs.
 [R. Belmont, Nick Boos]

-iteagle: add 1.02 bootrom, FPGA config ROMs, and PALs. [Brian Troha]

-SDL: Don't double-shutdown the font cache on *IX when exiting with the
 debugger enabled. [R. Belmont]
