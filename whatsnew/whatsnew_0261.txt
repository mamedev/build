11213: sega_beena: Playable WIP [qufb]
The driver can now play games, supporting all needed inputs except those requiring game specific peripherals.
Graphics are mostly done, there are still some issues which require a more accurate emulation of the pixel clock, which will be
  addressed after I disassemble some more games that make use of it. Currently it's used to support palette changes per scanline.
A new device is introduced for the Storyware (a booklet containing pages with artwork that can be interacted with a pen). An attempt
  was made to make it generic enough to eventually be reused for the Sega Pico / Yamaha Copera.
There are two main aspects about the Storyware device which I'm not entirely confident about:
1. To allow a player to specify page images, an environment variable needs to be set with the absolute path of the directory
  containing those images. I'd rather have used a command line option, but it seems only slots and picture_image_devices can be used
  to generate such options. I didn't use the latter, since it would be very cumbersome to pass about a dozen options for each page.
2. The Storyware has its own dedicate screen, which is separate from the main screen handling pen input for the tablet. A custom
  cursor is being rendered on the Storyware screen, since I couldn't get any other alternative to work as I expected:
    - Using the lightgun input port with a PORT_CROSSHAIR renders a cursor that is contained exclusively in the first screen, which
  would be fine (I could use the first screen for the Storyware), but the crosshair position is scaled to the input port's
  coordinates spanning all screens, i.e. the cursor moves in the first screen even if we are interacting with the second screen, and
  regardless of which screen we interact with, the cursor will be offset from the input port coordinates;
    - MACHINE_CLICKABLE_ARTWORK forces a pointer, but it's offset from the input port coordinates (instead it just follows the
  mouse);
EDIT: With the latest changes, the points raised above have been addressed.
---
Following this merge request I'll tackle audio support. I haven't yet seen much on how MAME handles MIDI playback, but at least OGG
  could use a third-party dependency for decoding (I was considering libogg since MAME already bundles libflac from the same
  authors).
EDIT: I've looked more into this and found that the BIOS streams OGGs as PCM data, so a new sound device should be enough.

These changes allow using the entries defined in the software list `sega_beena_cart.xml` with interfaces using a
  `rom_software_list_loader`. There were two main issues to address:
---
Issue 1: Regions for cart roms were specified with `width="32" endianness="big"`, supposedly to be aligned with the CPU's
  architecture. However, this also results in unintended swapping, besides what is already done with `load16_word_swap`. Here are
  some hex dumps of rom headers with different loading parameters to illustrate these effects:

```
There were 2 options to fix this:
- Either remove `load16_word_swap` and use `width="16"`, thus only swapping two bytes at a time;
- Or keep `load16_word_swap`, but use `endianness="little"`
Neither reflect the CPU's architecture, so I removed the `width` and `endianness` parameters, even though this is equivalent to the
  second option.
EDIT: Not an issue, as discussed below.
---
Issue 2: Regions for pages defined `size="0x2500000"`, which isn't enough to cover the full size expected for each region. I suppose
  the intention was to define a max page size. I modified the region size to use this max page size, multiplied by the number of
  pages. Additionally, I added an offset to each page, to make it more convenient for rom loading (as seen in the updated driver).

Pretty Doll [krugman]
All of these are copy-protected except First Crisis (it's a doujin release) and I have checked that all the working ones crash or
  complain if you try to run them from a copy made with DISKCOPY (the Votoms protection trigger is actually pretty funny, it
  replaces all the graphics with silly sprites), so I'm reasonably sure that MAME is emulating everything needed for the protection,
  at least for those.
About promoting Die Bahnwelt to working: I have tested it in old versions and indeed it didn't work at all (didn't recognize its own
  system disk). I haven't traced the exact commit, but it got fixed between 0.236 and 0.237, so I'm pretty sure that it is
  b8cd4f01c4abf27d598404176f72ae56394f0a00, since I haven't found anything else related to the 765 around that time.

AVR8:
- Optimized general-timer and SPI-timer handling.
- Templatized timer accessor functions in order to flatten branches and reduce runtime load.
- Approximately 1.5x speedup; `uzebox frogger` which ran at 82-83% unthrottled now runs at 146-147% unthrottled. Other AVR-based
  drivers show a similar speedup.

- hooked up MCU support in megasys1 driver [Sergio Galiano, Recreativos Piscis, David Haywood]
- started splitting megasys1 driver into subclasses [David Haywood]
- added 2 clones [unknown]
the clone sets have been kicking around in unemulated sets since the late 90s, probably Arcade ROMs from Japan or Romlist dumps /
  stuff that was sent to RAINEdev or similar.

11668: heathkit/h89.cpp: Add support for Kres KMR-100 ROM [mgarlanger]
Add support for Kres's KMR-100 ROM on the CPU board. This ROM is based on Ultimeth's ROM, and has some Kres specific functionality
  added.

11669: ins8250.cpp: Remove scratchpad register access to 8250 class chips [mgarlanger]
The original 8250 class chips did not have a scratchpad register at offset 7. This was added in the 16450. 
8250 datasheets specify this, and can be found in some old manuals like the Heath H89 or H19 manual. 
Here is the chart in an H89 manual.

It is also documented on this wiki, that the lack of the scratchpad was a way to determine it was an 8250 chip:

new machines marked as NOT WORKING
--------------------
Evolution Max [Team Europe, David Haywood]

11677: misc/calomega.cpp: ROM '23-02.u6' from 'comg230' is a NO_DUMP, not a BAD_DUMP [clawgrip]
An empty dump should be a NO_DUMP, not a BAD_DUMP. Having it as a BAD_DUMP just causes noise when checking ROMs, and it contains no
  info at all.

11679: subsino/subsino.cpp: Dumped and added the "Seven Land" missing ROMs [Taksangs] [clawgrip]
Clones promoted to working
----------------------------------------
Seven Land [Taksangs]
I've been playing for a while and I'd say it works ok. There's a gray stripe on the title screen, probably hiding the copyright

11687: misc/pass.cpp: Fix ROM labels [clawgrip]

11688: nabupc: Add nabu floppy disk formats [brijohn]
This adds a custom format to properly support  NABU floppy disks.
The NABU supports the following disk types:
  * 5.25" SSDD - 200k
  * 5.25" DSDD - 400k
  * 3.5"   DSDD - 800k
Each track contains 5 1024 byte sectors.
  
The in order to determine disk type filesystem layout of a disk the NABU embeds a CP/M Disk Parameter Block in the index gap of
  track 0. This patch injects the correct DPB data into the disk based on its type when loading raw images.

11689: universal/cosmic.cpp: Dumped and added a new Space Panic set [clawgrip]

The PCB can permanently disabled blanking interrupts, and it does so during power up. Writes to certain memory addresses will
  enable/disable the interrupt. Any write in the range will clear the current interrupt request. The logic in the schematic is not
  obvious, and it actually spawns to one more page at the end, but its functionality is modelled with this PR.

Also renamed "sunspckr" to "animalhs".

11708: Migrate cv1k and nexus3d drivers to use nandflash.h instead of serflash.h [buffis]
serflash.h looks real old and sortof messy, and is pretty much implementing the basic functionality of K9F1G08U0 (it has that
  manufacturer/device ID hardcoded).
It's only used by cv1k and nexus3d.cpp (which I'll also migrate in a followup, removing serflash).
nandflash.h seems newer, has support for SAMSUNG_K9F1G08U0B and looks less jank
Migrating to it is pretty straightforward and seems to work.
Only difference is the write to 0x10C00003 which controls the CE pin of U2 (through the U13 CPLD). serflash seems to have a setter
  for this (flash_enab_w), but I don't really see how it's needed. As far as I can understand, its only used to signal that U2
  should be the one to access the shared data-bus, which is a hardware limitation not relevant for emulation.
I assume that's why there's no handling of CE pin in nandflash.h/cpp
Tried a few different games, and seems to work fine

11728: Taito F3 cleanup [FredYeye]
I've looked at the taito F3 video code before, although at the time I didn't get very far. I recently decided to look at it again.
  The code is a bit hard to follow, so as part of getting to understand it a bit better, I've done some cleanup / updates to the
  code.
There are 3 commits:
taito_f3_v.cpp, taito_f3.h: turn code defines into functions
`Switch + define` were being used as unrolled `for` loops, these have been turned into normal `for` loops. Some defines were turned
  into functions/lambdas. There are still 2 code defines (`UPDATE_PIXMAP_SP`, `UPDATE_PIXMAP_LP`) left. I didn't come up with a good
  replacement solution, so no point in replacing them at this time.
taito_f3_v.cpp, taito_f3.h: use more appropriate data types for variables
A "narrowing pass". Maybe it's a lot of changes for one commit, though nothing has really changed. A lot of variables and function
  returns were just `int`, which made it hard to understand at a glance what the values could contain or mean.
taito_f3_v.cpp, taito_f3.h: remove fixed-scale version of drawgfx
The only real "controversial" change. Tl;dr: delete `f3_drawgfx()`. Rename `f3_drawgfxzoom` to `f3_drawgfx`.
 `f3_drawgfx()` appears to be a fixed-scale version of `f3_drawgfxzoom`. Removing the fixed-scale version doesn't appear to affect
  performance negatively in any significant way. Also, as a bonus, `f3_drawgfxzoom` looks more modern. My only reservation about
  this is that it's hard to say `f3_drawgfxzoom` for sure replaces `f3_drawgfx()` in every case. I think it does, but `f3_drawgfx()`
  uses some vintage optimization so they're hard to compare.
There are also some other misc changes, like `m_add_sat` becoming `constexpr` and replacing a manual sorting loop with `std::sort`.
---
These changes are mainly for readability. The last commit especially would be a big win, reducing code duplication.
I don't expect any significant perf changes. Rudimentary benchmarking (-bench 100 for a couple of F3 games) shows a -2% change, but
  it varies a lot between runs.
There's a lot that can be done, but this is a good start! I'll gladly take feedback on all this.

I've marked the game as CNW because I really don't know how to play these games, so I can't fully test it.

11750: upd933: rework irq to use a timer [devinacker]
From my still-in-progress CZ-1 driver, this mostly just changes interrupt generation to ensure accurate timing. Also better handling
  of interrupt priority (probably) and a couple of other miscellaneous things for the aforementioned driver.

11752: tms32025 neg instruction accidentally modifies ST0 instead of ST1 [codefrog2002]
The tms32025.cpp neg instruction, as coded, accidentally modifies ST0 instead of ST1.
The instruction should be modifying the C bit (in ST1) but the code calls SET0(C_FLAG) when it should call SET1(C_FLAG).
C_FLAG refers to a bit in ST1, not in ST0. 
Calling CLR0(C_FLAG) or SET0(C_FLAG) modifies ST0's INTM bit instead of ST1's C bit.
Reviewing the rest of the tms32025.cpp code, CLR1(C_FLAG) and SET1(C_FLAG) are used everywhere else.

11753: misc/majorpkr.cpp: Add two PLD dumps to 'syutnori' [Taksangs] [clawgrip]

11768: sega/stv.cpp: Add notes about Sports Fishing CD-ROM drive [clawgrip]

11770: psr150, psr180: fix erroneously swapped keys in input definitions [devinacker]
Apparently back when doing the ctk530 layout I somehow switched two lines and then failed to notice when recycling it for the psr150
  and psr180 layouts, which led to a couple of mistakes in the actual driver input definitions. This just puts things back in the
  right order.

11771: heathkit/tlb.cpp: Fix on-screen menus for superset tlbc slot option [mgarlanger]
Fixes the on-screen menu (ctrl-ESC brings it up) for the superset ROM/ tlbc slot option for the H19/H89.

11774: misc/majorpkr.cpp: Super Yutnori "10_palce20v8h.bin" dump turned out to be bad [clawgrip]

11775: cpu/powerpc: Remove illegal instruction exception for lmw invalid form case (MT08791) [987123879113]
Tested with tropchnc to make sure the original broken case is still working, as well as the landhigh and dendego3 games mentioned in
  the MAME testers report. landhigh gets to the title screen again and dendego3 boots to a question mark screen which is as far as
  it seems to go even without the invalid form checks I added in https://github.com/mamedev/mame/pull/11512.
After looking into it some more this week I saw in the 403 manuals it specifically states "The PPC403GCX executes all invalid
  instruction forms without causing an illegal instruction exception" (and similar for the other 403 variants). Couldn't find a
  direct mention of how to handle it in 60x manuals besides it just being undefined behavior, but it doesn't look like it should
  throw an illegal instruction exception there either based on the broken Taito PPC603-based games.

11778: heathkit/tlb.cpp: Use memory bank for imaginator I-100 ROM [mgarlanger]
Change from memory_view to memory bank for the Imaginator I-100 ROM.
