0.33 BETA 2

Well, you know that I usually don't celebrate recurrences, but we have just
hit the 500th ROM set supported (OK, OK, I know that many of them don't work)
and by pure coincidence it happens to be a very special one:

                Faster, Harder, More Challenging Q*Bert

This is a sequel to Q*Bert which was never released to the public. You can
find its story, as recalled by the author, Warren Davis, at
http://www.coinop.org/coinop/features/qbstory.html

Thanks to everyone who made this possible.


New ROM sets supported (in no particular order):
------------------------------------------------
Heavy Barrel (new, complete set). The old one has been renamed & modified to
  include 4 ROMs which were missing. [Bryan McPhail]
Magic Sword [Paul Leaman]
Space Dungeon [Dan Boris]
Slap Fight (preliminary) [Keith Wilkins]


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Fixed background layer colors in Trojan [Paul Leaman]

- Fixed invisible ball in Champion Baseball. Some of the graphics are still
  broken. The reason is unknown. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Adjusted the brightess of the background in Popeye, which should make it
  correct according to the schematics. Maybe now it's too dark?
  [Nicola Salmoria]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- Fixed fuel alert sound in Lunar Lander. [Keith Wilkins]

- Added speech to Champion Baseball. [Nicola Salmoria]


These drivers have HIGH SCORE support:

Other drivers changes:

  [Bryan McPhail]

- Further changes to the palette handling code.
  - osd_create_display() no longer takes the total_colors, palette, pens
  arguments. They are handled by osd_allocate_colors(), which is called after
  osd_create_display().
  - the convert_color_prom() functions now take a unsigned short *colortable
  parameter instead of unsigned char *.
  - Drivers for games which have a FIXED palette (i.e. they don't call
  osd_modify_pen()) of more than 256 colors are now allowed to declare it as
  such in the MachineDriver. The palette will be automatically shrinked to fit
  in 256 colors. Note: this assumes that the palette is actually composed of
  no more than 256 unique colors. This is currently the case in all the games.
  Examples: Kung Fu Master, Lode Runner, Arkanoid, Popeye.
  - instead of calling osd_modify_pen(Machine->pens[color],r,g,b), drivers
  should call palette_change_color(color,r,g,b). Note that the function does
  the Machine->pens[] mapping for you.

- Added WatchPoint support to the debugger (i.e. check a RAM location and stop
  execution whe it is changed). [Ernesto Corvi]

- Fixed a bug in 6502/dasm.c (this only applies if you compile it to get a
  standalone disassembler - it is not part of MAME) [Christophe Verre]
