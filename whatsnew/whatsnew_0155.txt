 play "Super Mario Land" with the custom palettes of the Game Boy
 Color. [Fabio Priuli]

-NS8250 Fixes [smf] 
  * Loopback: tx goes high and data is clocked at the
	correct rate instead of appearing instantly Modem status register:
	don't lose track of external signals when starting, resetting,
	switching loopback off, writing to register Handshaking: active low
	for consistency (RS232 port now defaults handshaking lines high and
	serial mouse dtr/rts handling has been adjusted).

-Memory system and Namco improvements: [Alex Jackson]

  * Explicit regions in address maps (AM_REGION) are now looked up
	relative to the device rather than as siblings when in an internal
	address map (similar to devices and shared pointers)  Besides being
	more orthogonal than before, this allows internal ROMs of MCUs and
	similar devices to be hooked up in a nicer and more foolproof way.
	Updated the m37710 and m5074x (m6502 derivative) to take advantage of
	this.
	
  * Divided the M37702/M37710 into specific models, with each model having
	its own internal address map containing the correct amounts of
	internal RAM and ROM.
 
  * M37702 MCUs found on various Namco PCBs are now all unique devices and
	have their respective internal ROMs loaded as device ROMs.

-namcops2: Documentation fixes [Guru]

-addrmap.c: Only install the default device address map if the owner
 didn't provide one [Alex Jackson]

-8250: call interrupt callback after clearing internal interrupt state
 when resetting [smf]

-added workaround to build with XCode 6.0.1 out-of-the-box
 [Oliver Stöneberg]

-wd_fdc: Hopefully fix reading sectors with DDAM [lowen, O. Galibert]

-Moved protection vectors from hachamfb to hachamf, making the latter
 to work properly too [Angelo Salese]

-web: allow pasting in text. [Firehawke]

-Gundam Wing: Endless Duel updates: [Peter Ferrie]
 * added additional shared memory block
 * added protection handlers
 * corrected reset vector
 * worked around bad startup
 Game now boots but doesn't coin up.

-model3: New 3D renderer + various fixes (still heavily WIP) [Ville Linde]

-Beatmania IIDX Twinkle hardware: The IDE DMA is now hooked up, but the
 sound board isn't running well enough yet for it to make a difference.
 Hooked up the FDC37665GT and HLE the XVD701 and the 68k sound board
 responses to get most of the games booting. There is no sound and the
 games all fail with a hdd error when you start a stage. Beatmania IIDX
 with DDR 2nd Club Version wants the GQ863 hard disk. [smf]

-Beatmania IIDX Twinkle hardware: beatmania IIDX Substream with DDR 2nd
