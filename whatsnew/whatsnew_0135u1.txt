Source Changes
--------------
Updated LFO information in YMF271 core. [Brian Troha, Nicola Salmoria]

Fixed parent relationship between sbrkout3 and sbrkout. 
[Lord Nightmare]

Removed some magic numbers from machine/psx.c, replaced with #defines.
[Harmony]

Change to consistently use Intel notation for hex values in TMS32010 
disassembler, rather than a mix of Motorola and Intel notation.
[Lord Nightmare]

Z80: Check for NOP in interrupt mode 0. This allows code like ei / 
halt / di to work correctly. A better solution would be to implement 
full support for arbitrary opcodes in mode 0. [Dirk Best]

igs017.c update [Luca Elia]
 - Merged in some IGS031 based games (igs_m68.c, tarzan.c)

(Top Racer) sets. Removed Namco devices from bootlegs which don't 
have them. [David Haywood]

Added save state support to plygonet.c and the DSP56156 CPU core.
[Andrew Gardner]

Updated SN76489/A to have correct PRNG waveforms (a 0 bit was missing 
at the beginning, and beginning of SN76489 waveform was all 1s 
instead of 0s as measured on hardware). Added SN94624 (same as 
SN76489). [Lord Nightmare, plgDavid (David Viens)]

i386 core fixes: [Barry Rodewald]

    implemented in any way, but can now be set or reset.  Can be used 
    to detect a 80386 or later CPU.
 * Implemented ENTER instruction.
 * Made IRQ vectors treated as 8 bytes when in protected mode, and 
    made the addresses pushed onto the stack 32-bit if the gate 
    descriptor used is a 386 interrupt or trap gate (also when in 
    protected mode, will always be 16-bit if in real mode).

Fixes to default mapping as well as comment/information fixes for 
Mole Attack [M.A.S.H./Tafoid]

Identify puyoj set as Rev B and correct various rom names.
[Smitdogg, Dumping Union]

    much improved)
 * Added the alt tilemap layout used by f1superb for the backgrounds
 * Added f1superb notes and IRQ generation code from nuapete

Tournament Solitaire (pcat_dyn) improvements [luigi30]:

    the new one is now toursol
 * Set toursol date to 1995
 * Set toursol CPU speed to 40MHz

Many improvements to konamigx rendering, specifically improving 
Soccer Superstars and Rushing Hero. [David Haywood, Angelo Salese]

Implemented input buffer copy protection in Rushing Heroes, game is 
now somewhat playable with heavy gfx glitches [Angelo Salese]

bank in Run & Gun 2 / Slam Dunk 2 [Angelo Salese]

Fixed sprite ROM loading in Slam Dunk 2 [David Haywood]

Control fix for Strike Gunner S.T.G. to allow a 3rd button mapping 
for each player - thus allowing for the feature of merging ships in 2

 - Fixed disassembly for EC/LC variants of '030/'040

Patched NVRAM check in Jackpot Cards, makes the game playable but you 
cannot save settings so it's not yet working. [Angelo Salese]

Trashed the old pre-accurate-clocking STEP based sample averaging 
scheme from sn76489 and friends, vastly simplifying the code. Made 
the output bipolar rather than only above the 0 line. Added missing 
statement to the get_safe_token function for the recently added 
SN94624. [Lord Nightmare]

Many N64 RDP fixes. 
[angrylion, Ziggy, Gonetz, Orkin, DrgnMndd, Harmony]

Cleaned up toaplan2 V25 support, enabled Batsugun V25 and added 
decryption table info for the other games [David Haywood]

Improved the V25S memory map in Batsugun, now CPUs starts to

[Lord Nightmare, Justin Kerk]
