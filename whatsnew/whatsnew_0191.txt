-Added newer version of Mephisto Academy (German) as BIOS option. [yoyo_chessboard]

-Remove partial updates from Tokio video, fixes MT #06691 [Lord Nightmare]

-psx.xml: Added 76 new dumps, replaced 2 bad dumps Based on the redump.org PSX dat from 2017-10-10, I've added 76 new dumps (mostly
 demos, cheat applications and Lightspan discs), replaced two bad dumps and renamed a couple of original images to keep them synced
 with their corresponding redump entries. [aeternal606]

-Fixed an options overhaul regression (#2530) [npwoods]
 * This crash (discovered by Wizz) had the following symptoms: 1.  Start MAME 2.  Choose "Configure Machine" 3.  Choose "Video
    Options" CRASH
 * This was the result of the options editor not having a fully formed list of options where it was expecting one.  The fix is to
    change the declaration of emu_options to one that have full OSD options (it is possible that SDLMAME needs something slightly
    different)
 * I created a osd_setup_osd_specific_emu_options(emu_options &) function that given an emu_options, will slap on system specific
    options.  I see this as only marginally less gross, and I have zero opinion on whether this should be changed to return an
    emu_options (rather than have a reference parameter), be a static method on emu_options, or what have you.

-psx.xml: Added 76 new dumps, replaced 2 bad dumps (#2712) [aeternal606]
 * Based on the redump.org PSX dat from 2017-10-10, I've added 76 new dumps (mostly demos, cheat applications and Lightspan discs),
    replaced two bad dumps and renamed a couple of original images to keep them synced with their corresponding redump entries.

-Created a more flexible imgtool::datetime structure for use within Imgtool (#2263) [npwoods]
 * Created a more flexible imgtool::datetime structure for use within Imgtool
 * This is intended to replace most usage of time_t
 * Changing the granularity of imgtool_clock from 1ms to 100ns, as per Vas' suggestion
 * Created arbitrary_datetime in timeconv.h to facilitate interpretation of datetime info
 * I concluded that invoking std::mktime on manually assembled std::tm is bad, because it is indeterminate how the std::tm members
    may be "dominant".  This required that I go further in imgtool, and update a number of drivers and eliminate the parameter of
    imgtool::datetime that takes std::tm.

-gaelco.cpp: Correct various clock speeds & add PCB layout for Biomechanical Toy. [Brian Troha]

-Added support for multiple PORT_CHAR() bindings, and adopted in the CoCo driver  (addresses MT#2618) [npwoods]

-Fixed an options overhaul regression This crash (discovered by Wizz) had the following symptoms: 1.  Start MAME 2.  Choose
 "Configure Machine" 3.  Choose "Video Options" CRASH [npwoods]
 * This was the result of the options editor not having a fully formed list of options where it was expecting one.  The fix is to
    change the declaration of emu_options to one that have full OSD options (it is possible that SDLMAME needs something slightly
    different)
 * Please scrutinize this fix.  I hate it.  I also hate how all of the OSD options are duplicatively declared in submenu.cpp, but
    with a different data structure.  At the very least we should be having some sort of factory to create "full" options for the
    pertinent platform; but I'm not sure how precisely we would want it to work.

-Created a more flexible imgtool::datetime structure for use within Imgtool This is intended to replace most usage of time_t
 [npwoods]
