-aristmk6.cpp: fixed BIOS loading and some BIOS naming; removed an
 overdumped BIOS and moved qnilese base PCB ROMS to the BIOS set.
 [Heihachi_73, Fabio Priuli]

-gba.cpp: several improvements [Fabio Priuli]
 * Implemented emulation of the  "General Purpose I/O" port (GPIO) of
    GBA.
 * Hooked up S-3511 RTC emulation through the GPIO port. This allows
    to avoid the "Internal battery has run dry [...] clock-based
    events will no longer occur" messages in Pokémon Emerald / Ruby /
    Sapphire. This also promotes Sennen Kazoku to working state.
 * Hooked up Boktai Light Sensor emulation through the GPIO port. This
    allows to avoid the "Solar Sensor is broken" message in Boktai /
    Bokura no Taiyou, which is now playable and to recharge your
    weapons in all three games of the series. Light level has to be
    chosen via the "Machine Configuration" menu, until we get some
    kind of camera input.
 * Hooked up Warioware Twist Gyroscope emulation through the GPIO
    port. This allows to play the minigames, even if in some case the
    input sensibility might need a few tweaks.
 * Hooked up Warioware Twist & Drill Dozer Rumble emulation through
    the GPIO port. MAME will now output a "Rumble" output bit (0 for
    Rumble=OFF and 1 for Rumble=ON) whenever the games try to access
    the Rumble component… third party applications can now listen to
    the output and redirect it to some hardware that can "rumble" in
    sync with the gameplay.

-gba.cpp: implemented emulation of the Tilt sensor used by Yoshi’s
 Universal Gravitation / Yoshi Topsy-Turvy / Yoshi no Banyuuinryoku
 (and by Koro Koro Puzzle). Note that the calibration can seem a bit 
 tricky at first, because the emulated screen does not turn as the GBA
 would... In order to properly calibrate the sensor, just keep pressed
 right for a few seconds when requested to calibrate right inclination 
 (first calibration screen in Yoshi Universal Gravitation) so to get
 the full right range; then keep pressed for left for a few seconds
 when requested to calibrate left inclination (second calibration
 screen in Yoshi Universal Gravitation) so to get the full left range.
 [Fabio Priuli]

-gb.cpp: Added Rumble emulation to the MBC-5 Game Boy Color games which
 supported it. MAME will now output a "Rumble" output bit (0 for
 Rumble=OFF and 1 for Rumble=ON) whenever the games try to access the
 Rumble component… third party applications can now listen to the
 output and redirect it to some hardware that can "rumble" in sync with
 the gameplay. [Fabio Priuli]

-gb.cpp: Added partial RTC emulation to the MBC-3 Game Boy Color games
 which supported it. Clock proceeds a bit too fast during gameplay, but
 at least it is not stuck anymore to the time of first configuration.
 [Fabio Priuli]

-* Added constructors to prepare to move terminal setup into
    constructor.
 * Reworked twoterm setup. Fixed some timebombs along the way.
 * Fix r2r dac. Remove dead code.
 * analog_outputs now created in constructor.
 * moved analog_input creation into constructor.
 * moved logic output creation to constructor.
 * moved all logic inputs into constructor.
 * Completely removed init_object. Finally. [Couriersud]
 * More code cleanup.
 * Dead code removal and minor refactoring.
 * Simplify. Align naming with stl. Fix somed pedantic warnings.
 * More STL compatability.
 * Remove ATTR_HOT and ATTR_COLD. Refactored netlist_time.
 * Fix long standing workaround which would ignore policy of
    change-only" propagation.
 * Rewrote for loops to use auto : semantics.
 * Get rid of nl_math. Remove nl_util.h and moved contents to
    plib/putil.h.
 * Fix standalone build. Refactor ptypes.h. [Couriersud]

-Major refactoring of debugger core [Ryan Holtz]
 * Eliminate globals/file statics
 * Remove lots of stuff from global scope
 * Use std::function for custom command registration
 * Eliminate some trampolines
 * Build fixes from Vas Crabb and balr0g

-n64.cpp: Disabled fast RAM, as it prevents watchpoints from working
 and doesn't gain much on the interpreter core. [Ryan Holtz]

-rainbow.cpp: add 23-090b1 z80 arbitrator PROM dump [Lord Nightmare]

-Buena Suerte: Completed the Protel PCB set. Rearranged the graphics
 ROMs to get accurate gfx banks. Discrete sound needs to be traced.
 Game is working properly. [Roberto Fresca]

-Buena Suerte (Protel PCB): Added technical notes and a WIP edge
 connector and mech counters pinout. [Roberto Fresca, Gaby]

-fl7_3121: promoted to working [Vas Crabb]
 * Correct DS2401 hookup on PIA 0 port C

-Fix keyboard shortcus for disassembly comments pane [Vas Crabb]
 * Win32 previously recognised Ctrl+N but menu incorrectly showed
    Ctrl+M
 * Qt showed Ctrl+C but it was swallowed by text editing and didn't
    work
 * Ctrl+N is now shown/used by Win32 and Qt (matches Cmd-N on OS X)

-Fix git version [Vas Crabb]
 * git version is set by top-level make, not just when GENie runs
 * can set IGNORE_GIT=1 for make to ignore git
 * git ignored/unavailable uses "unknown" in version string
 * mark modified trees as dirty
 * note that version now comes from makefile

-Major Poker: Added missing PLDs, plus technical notes. [Roberto Fresca]

 launching). Many thanks to r09 and Breiztiger for help with info and
 images. [Fabio Priuli]

-gameboy: Added DMG v0 boot rom. [gekkio]

-abc80x: Added ROM version 1.05 for the 55-21046 disk controller. [Anders Sandahl]

-Memory fun [O.Galibert]
 * Added AM_SELECT/addrselect field.  Replaces the old
    AM_MIRROR/AM_MASK combo used to mirror a handler and get the
    mirrored bits in the offset.
 * Removed mask and/or mirror from where it didn't belong.  Simplified
    a lot of instances of mask that just weren't needed, especially in
    bus handlers.  Used the short forms of install handlers where
    possible.
 * Replaced the 60s hippy, "It's cool man" range parameter handling in
    map_range that tried to guess what was meant when the values
    passed were not entirely sensible, by a cranky, diner
    waitress-turned IRS auditor curmudgeon.  Main control function has
    a series of 14 tests just to find a reason to fatalerror out your
    requests.  You have been warned.

-Fixed double hyphen in -pipe [belegdol]

-aristmk5.cpp: unified rom naming and added a few sets that were
 missing. [Heihachi_73]

-Add basic SPARCv7 core [Ryan Holtz]

-Flaming 7: Decrypted the graphics ROMs & fixed the gfxdecode. Bipolar
 PROM decode is still wrong. [Roberto Fresca]

-apollo: install the unmapped handler in the correct post-trampoline range [O. Galibert]

-l9nibble: If it's a tms9900, put one, because the 9980 address space
 is too small [O. Galibert]

-prox180x,pve500: Map fix [O. Galibert]

-Netlist changes
 * Replaced shared_ptr by unique_ptr.
 * Better seperation of setup_t and netlist_t.
 * Fixed bugs in rdtsc code. Refactored timer code.
 * Simplify conditional activation/deactivation.
 * Introduced HINT(device, hint) to clarify that hints are inheritent
    and not specific to devices.
 * Added improved profiling support to netlist. Statistics output now
    proposes devices for which whole device activation/deactivation be
    disabled. No significant improvement for pong, but breakout
    experiences a 10% improvement.
 * Moved options code from include to cpp file.
 * Minor modifications to 7493 and 9316
 * Introduced perftime_t and perfcount_t for gathering statistics.
    These templates do not create any code if statistics are not kept.
 * Make help2man ./nltool produce usuable output.
 * More truthtable refactoring. Removed half-finished code for

    support for timing delays. [Couriersud]

-Rewrite SPARC emulation based on detailed descriptions from SPARC manual [Ryan Holtz]

-galpani3.cpp: Added correct supplemental graphics roms to the Gals
 Panic 3 (Hong Kong) set. [Brian Troha, The Dumping Union]

 * Note that this omits non-VIS OSA 2007/2011 features
 * VIS 2+ ldtxa/ldtwa/sttwa still uses ldda/stda, using new mnemonics
    requires special-casing this instruction and checking ASI

-dec_lk201: keyclick [Bavarese] 

-Added "return to origin point (0,0)" feature to Tilemap Viewer (tied
 with HOME key) [Angelo Salese]

-Improved workaround for missing cbegin/cend in glibstdc++ [Alex Miller]

-sg1000.cpp: many improvements [Enik Land]
 * Create a SG-1000 expansion slot.
 * Hook up the SG-1000 expansion slot to sg1000.cpp and sms.cpp
    (sg1000m3).
 * Split the sk1100 code from sg1000.cpp and attach it to the new
    expansion slot.
 * Create a new FM Sound Unit device and attach it to the new
    expansion slot.
 * For the sc3000 driver, re-add sk1100 as a fixed SG-1000 expansion
    device.
 * Add sg1000 software list to sg1000m3 and Japanese/Korean SMS
    drivers.

-sms.cpp: implemented some new findings [Enik Land]
 * Remove some mirrors for ports $DC/$DD on SMSJ based on Charles' hw
    tests.
 * Add basic C-Sync callback to 315_5124.cpp, based on Charles' hw
    tests.
 * Add built-in Rapid Fire (uses C-Sync) for SMSJ and Korean SMS1
    drivers.
 * Add new SMS drivers due to XTAL differences: sms1br - Tec Toy
    Master System I (Brazil) sms2br - Tec Toy Master System II
    (Brazil) smsbr - Tec Toy Master System III Compact (Brazil)
    sms1paln - Tec Toy Master System I (PAL-N) sms2paln - Tec Toy
    Master System II (PAL-N) smspaln - Tec Toy Master System III
    Compact (PAL-N) Brazil is PAL-M TV system, but I decided to call
    it by the country name, seems to be better recognizable and for
    emulation looks more like a NTSC system. PAL-N is used in
    Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay and looks closer to the European
    PAL system when compared to PAL-M.

-Load save state preparations [Nathan Woods]
 * A number of changes and refactorings in preparation for a new
    load/save state menu. Most notably, I am C++-ifying osd_directory
    (now osd::directory) and changing osd_stat() to return
    std::unique_ptrosd::directory::entry
 * Take note that this change completely omits POSIX support, simply
    because I lack a development environment to support it. This will
    have to be done by someone else.
	
-POSIX implementation for new directory read features, cleanup of
 Windows implementation, return directory handle as smart pointer, fix
 full build [Vas Crabb]

-cop: nicer sorting routine [O. Galibert]

-Supply modified time for files in archives [Vas Crabb]

-Fix LDUH, LDSH, LDUHA, and LDSHA opcodes in the SPARC core [Ryan Holtz]
