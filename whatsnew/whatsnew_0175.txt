-gba.xml: documented some more Game Boy Advance PCBs. [Fabio Priuli]

-gba.cpp: several improvements [Fabio Priuli]
 * Implemented emulation of the  "General Purpose I/O" port (GPIO) of
    GBA.
 * Hooked up S-3511 RTC emulation through the GPIO port. This allows
    to avoid the "Internal battery has run dry [...] clock-based
    events will no longer occur" messages in Pokémon Emerald / Ruby /
    Sapphire. This also promotes Sennen Kazoku to working state.
 * Hooked up Boktai Light Sensor emulation through the GPIO port. This
    allows to avoid the "Solar Sensor is broken" message in Boktai /
    Bokura no Taiyou, which is now playable and to recharge your
    weapons in all three games of the series. Light level has to be
    chosen via the "Machine Configuration" menu, until we get some
    kind of camera input.
 * Hooked up Warioware Twist Gyroscope emulation through the GPIO
    port. This allows to play the minigames, even if in some case the
    input sensibility might need a few tweaks.
 * Hooked up Warioware Twist & Drill Dozer Rumble emulation through
    the GPIO port. MAME will now output a "Rumble" output bit (0 for
    Rumble=OFF and 1 for Rumble=ON) whenever the games try to access
    the Rumble component… third party applications can now listen to
    the output and redirect it to some hardware that can "rumble" in
    sync with the gameplay.

-gba.cpp: implemented emulation of the Tilt sensor used by Yoshi’s
 Universal Gravitation / Yoshi Topsy-Turvy / Yoshi no Banyuuinryoku
 (and by Koro Koro Puzzle). Note that the calibration can seem a bit 
 tricky at first, because the emulated screen does not turn as the GBA
 would... In order to properly calibrate the sensor, just keep pressed
 right for a few seconds when requested to calibrate right inclination 
 (first calibration screen in Yoshi Universal Gravitation) so to get
 the full right range; then keep pressed for left for a few seconds
 when requested to calibrate left inclination (second calibration
 screen in Yoshi Universal Gravitation) so to get the full left range.
 [Fabio Priuli]

-gb.cpp: Added Rumble emulation to the MBC-5 Game Boy Color games which
 supported it. MAME will now output a "Rumble" output bit (0 for
 Rumble=OFF and 1 for Rumble=ON) whenever the games try to access the
 Rumble component… third party applications can now listen to the
 output and redirect it to some hardware that can "rumble" in sync with
 the gameplay. [Fabio Priuli]

-gb.cpp: Added partial RTC emulation to the MBC-3 Game Boy Color games
 which supported it. Clock proceeds a bit too fast during gameplay, but
 at least it is not stuck anymore to the time of first configuration.
 [Fabio Priuli]

-Netlist changes [Couriersud]
 * Introduced HINT(device, hint) to clarify that hints are inheritent
    and not specific to devices.
 * Added improved profiling support to netlist. Statistics output now
    proposes devices for which whole device activation/deactivation be
    disabled. No significant improvement for pong, but breakout
    experiences a 10% improvement.
 * Introduced perftime_t and perfcount_t for gathering statistics.
    These templates do not create any code if statistics are not kept.
 * Make help2man ./nltool produce usuable output.
 * Replaced shared_ptr by unique_ptr.
 * Better seperation of setup_t and netlist_t.
 * Fixed bugs in rdtsc code. Refactored timer code.
 * Moved options code from include to cpp file.
 * More truthtable refactoring. Removed half-finished code for
    internal state support. As implemented, this would have had no
    support for timing delays. 
 * All netlist device setup is now done in the device constructor. This
    significantly increases readability and stability and allowed to remove
    init_object calls and start calls.
 * Removed a significant amount of dead code.
 * Remove ATTR_HOT and ATTR_COLD. Refactored netlist_time.
 * More STL usage and c++11.
 * Get rid of nl_math. Remove nl_util.h and moved contents to
    plib/putil.h.

-Major refactoring of debugger core [Ryan Holtz]
 * Eliminate globals/file statics
 * Remove lots of stuff from global scope
 * Use std::function for custom command registration
 * Eliminate some trampolines
 * Build fixes from Vas Crabb and balr0g

-n64.cpp: Disabled fast RAM, as it prevents watchpoints from working
 and doesn't gain much on the interpreter core. [Ryan Holtz]

-rainbow.cpp: add 23-090b1 z80 arbitrator PROM dump [Lord Nightmare]

-Small update of italian traslation [AntoPISA]

-Fix keyboard shortcus for disassembly comments pane [Vas Crabb]
 * Win32 previously recognised Ctrl+N but menu incorrectly showed
    Ctrl+M
 * Qt showed Ctrl+C but it was swallowed by text editing and didn't
    work
 * Ctrl+N is now shown/used by Win32 and Qt (matches Cmd-N on OS X)

-Fix git version [Vas Crabb]
 * git version is set by top-level make, not just when GENie runs
 * can set IGNORE_GIT=1 for make to ignore git
 * git ignored/unavailable uses "unknown" in version string
 * mark modified trees as dirty
 * note that version now comes from makefile

-A little change to device_image_interface::call_display to better
 decouple UI fronted and image devices [F.Ulivi]

-Rom for GameKing 3 [PeT, James]

-fmtowns_cd.xml: added more info, based on Breiztiger's research [Fabio Priuli]

-fmtowns_flop.xml: added a new software list for floppy-only FM Towns

 launching). Many thanks to r09 and Breiztiger for help with info and
 images. [Fabio Priuli]

-gameboy: Added DMG v0 boot rom. [gekkio]

-sdk80: Added correct monitor ROM. [Nigel Barnes]

-imds2: Added monitor versions 1.1 and 1.2. [Nigel Barnes]

-terminal: Fixed Color configuration. [Nigel Barnes]

-Memory fun [O.Galibert]
 * Added AM_SELECT/addrselect field.  Replaces the old
    AM_MIRROR/AM_MASK combo used to mirror a handler and get the
    mirrored bits in the offset.
 * Removed mask and/or mirror from where it didn't belong.  Simplified
    a lot of instances of mask that just weren't needed, especially in
    bus handlers.  Used the short forms of install handlers where
    possible.
 * Replaced the 60s hippy, "It's cool man" range parameter handling in
    map_range that tried to guess what was meant when the values
    passed were not entirely sensible, by a cranky, diner
    waitress-turned IRS auditor curmudgeon.  Main control function has
    a series of 14 tests just to find a reason to fatalerror out your
    requests.  You have been warned.

-Fixed double hyphen in -pipe [belegdol]

-sg1000.cpp: many improvements [Enik Land]
 * Create a SG-1000 expansion slot.
 * Hook up the SG-1000 expansion slot to sg1000.cpp and sms.cpp
    (sg1000m3).
 * Split the sk1100 code from sg1000.cpp and attach it to the new
    expansion slot.
 * Create a new FM Sound Unit device and attach it to the new
    expansion slot.
 * For the sc3000 driver, re-add sk1100 as a fixed SG-1000 expansion
    device.
 * Add sg1000 software list to sg1000m3 and Japanese/Korean SMS
    drivers.

-sms.cpp: implemented some new findings [Enik Land]
 * Remove some mirrors for ports $DC/$DD on SMSJ based on Charles' hw
    tests.
 * Add basic C-Sync callback to 315_5124.cpp, based on Charles' hw
    tests.
 * Add built-in Rapid Fire (uses C-Sync) for SMSJ and Korean SMS1
    drivers.
 * Add new SMS drivers due to XTAL differences: sms1br - Tec Toy
    Master System I (Brazil) sms2br - Tec Toy Master System II
    (Brazil) smsbr - Tec Toy Master System III Compact (Brazil)
    sms1paln - Tec Toy Master System I (PAL-N) sms2paln - Tec Toy
    Master System II (PAL-N) smspaln - Tec Toy Master System III
    Compact (PAL-N) Brazil is PAL-M TV system, but I decided to call
    it by the country name, seems to be better recognizable and for
    emulation looks more like a NTSC system. PAL-N is used in
    Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay and looks closer to the European
    PAL system when compared to PAL-M.

-Load save state preparations [Nathan Woods]
 * A number of changes and refactorings in preparation for a new
    load/save state menu. Most notably, I am C++-ifying osd_directory
    (now osd::directory) and changing osd_stat() to return
    std::unique_ptrosd::directory::entry
 * Take note that this change completely omits POSIX support, simply
    because I lack a development environment to support it. This will
    have to be done by someone else.
	
-POSIX implementation for new directory read features, cleanup of
 Windows implementation, return directory handle as smart pointer, fix
 full build [Vas Crabb]

-cop: nicer sorting routine [O. Galibert]

-Supply modified time for files in archives [Vas Crabb]

-Fix LDUH, LDSH, LDUHA, and LDSHA opcodes in the SPARC core [Ryan Holtz]

-ImGui debugger improvements  [Barry Rodewald]

   allows finer control of large memory areas.
 * Pressing Enter on an empty debugger console input now does a single
   step.
 * Disassembly and Memory expression inputs now auto-select all.
 * Fix various key inputs.
 * Send character inputs to views, allowing memory editing to be possible
   in a memory window.
 * Show a rectangle around the view with focus.
 * Add history functionality (press up/down in the debugger console input
   widget)
 * Allow log windows and debugger console scrollbars to stay at their
   maximum value, if moved there.
