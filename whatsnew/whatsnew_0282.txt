The revision refers to the Windows 11 Chinese Simplified menu buttons and option titles, many places are still not perfect, modify
  it again and again!Characteristic:
(1) Corrected the traditional and English characters that are currently left in MAME, such as 統 (统), 將 (将), (INI)（初始化）, etc., Figure
  1
(2) Depending on the region, the name will be based on the mainland rather than Hong Kong and Taiwan, such as 画面(荧幕), 程序 (程式), 导出
  (汇出), etc., Figure 2
(3) Delete duplicate redundant or unobstructed notes, etc., Figure 3
(4) Added the complete plug-in items that have not yet been integrated, Figure 4.

The processed Simplified Chinese language pack has been very popular on gaming websites in China, with 42 of the 91 new games added
  last month coming from mainland China, and they will donate more boards for the MAME project team to test!

14127: Roland PG-1000: Added internal layout and complete driver implementation [felipesanches]

14146: softlist: splitted programmer into multiple entries [holub]

14149: att6300p.cpp: Initial driver for AT&T 6300 Plus [donohoe00]
Initial driver for the AT&T 6300 plus.  It seems to run DOS just fine.
The 6300 Plus contains unique hardware to support a virtual 8086 environment allowing DOS to run concurrently with, and under the
  control of, a version of AT&T SVR 2.0 Unix that was specifically provided for this machine.  While I've attempted to implement the
  virtualization hardware, it's largely untested and would definitely need more work.  Unless someone unearths a copy of the right
  version of Unix (and the accompanying OS Merge software), the virtualization implementation cannot be completed and fully
  verified.  There are more details in the code comments about the exact version of Unix that's needed.
This is not your run-of-the-mill PC clone, and I'm expecting to get a lot of feedback, especially about how I hooked into accesses
  from the CPU to implement the virtualization.
Note that this PR includes a proposed change to how the i86/i286 registers are initialized upon reset.  This is obviously a risky
  change, but the BIOS fails when performing the memory check without it (since it fails to return from protected mode to real mode
  when testing memory above 640K).

14186: cpu/i960: store IRQ line states, immediately return if unchanged [gm-matthew]
If a particular IRQ line is already high, trying to assert another IRQ on the same line no longer has any effect; the IRQ line must
  be cleared/lowered first before another IRQ can be asserted.
IRQ acknowledgement logic has been implemented for Namco System FL, since it is now required with the i960 update.

14194: update element order in four more Yamaha keyboard layouts [devinacker]
These are the last layouts I'm aware of that needed updating for #14113.

14195: Set IP_ACTIVE_HIGH to low marywu.cpp [flama12333]

14197: bus/megadrive/cart: initial pass at a new cart slot interface [angelosa]
Hooked up to Teradrive only as WIP intermediate step.
List of improvements and changes compared to legacy handling (some of these also applies there):
- Implement `gamenko` Seganet mapper;
- Implement `menghu` mapper (a Gamtec variant using Z80 to read protection data);
- Implement `sanguo5` / `tunshi` mapper (uses SRAM with invalid header);
- Implement `sportg` Tectoy 3-in-1 mapper;
- Hookup SRAM in `yasech` mapper;
- fix `btlchess` mapper;
- Implement `16mj2` extra ports reads;
- Fix `sampras` hanging on menu (uses a J-Cart variant);
- Hookup J-Cart for `sskid`;
- Allow `ninjab` to boot with proper I2C mapper;
- Fix I2C mappers for `billwlsh`,  `madden93`, `madd93ce`, `shanewar`;
- Add SRAM for `mightmg3`;
- Fix `beggarp1`, it relocates SRAM address more akin to sf002/wukong mapper;
- Fix `barkley2`: it uses mirroring for SRAM, crashing in tournament mode if it doesn't find it;
- `sonic3` "fram" area doesn't exist anymore, use "sram" instead;
- Retire `rom_radica` from legacy handling: it has been moved as standalone sega/megadriv_rad.cpp driver starting from #3108
- Retire `rom_topf` from legacy handling: was a broken version of `rom_lion3`;

New WORKING clone
-------------------------------
E.D.F.: Earth Defense Force (set 3) [Sergio Galiano, Recreativos Piscis]
There are no date strings on the program ROM nor text or warning screen which could hint if this is a newer or older version, so I
  simply added it as "(set 3)".
I also added the dump of the MCU in "peekaboo" on the same driver. This time I only added the ROM entry and has no real effect in
  emulation, it needs to be hooked up, because it works differently than the MCU in other games on the same driver.
As far as I can see in the initializing code, there are some differences in the device configuration:
- Port1 is used as output instead of input
- Port3 is used as standard output port instead using /RD, /WR... signals.
- Timer 1 is used for some task, and INTT1 flag is enabled for that cause.
- Port7 is also used as output port (not used in other MCU dumps)

It is completely non-functional. The loading code is commented out, and the saving code crashes, because it attempts to access 70
  tracks regardless of how many there actually are.
The code has been in this state ever since it's been added in 36ea482a, so it seems unlikely that it'll improve. Moreover, its
  utility seems questionable: I haven't been able to find a single floppy image with an .rti extension (and there are none listed in
  the software list). OTOH, for every game mentioned in the description, there are WOZ images that can be used instead (except for
  The Toy Shop, which has DSK images).

14263: bk: parallel expansion slot and carts [shattered]

14264: Added emulation of a CEM3320-based 4th-order LPF, and used it on the linndrum.  [m1macrophage]
* Added a generic 4-th order resonant LPF (VA_LPF4), based on the implementation in esq1.cpp.
  * Copied some of the code and comments  from `esq1.cpp`, with credit on the file copyright.
* Added a CEM3320_LPF4 specialization.
* Used the CEM3320_LPF4 on the linndrum.
* Implemented the corresponding VCF envelope generators on the linndrum.
* Fixed typos and comments.
The LinnDrum VCFs do not use resonance. Resonance functionality was tested by locally using the resonance configuration of the
  prophet5.

14265: Prevent NTSC/PAL NES from loading games that need the Expansion port [FoxhackDN]
This change prevents loading all variants of Family Basic carts and Family Trainer games on non-Japanese hardware. Since stock
  systems lack the expansion port to use the keyboard (and consequentially, the audio port for the tape deck), and the Family
  Trainer pad uses a different interface compared to the US / PAL releases, this renders them unusable. It also causes the same
  issues that were mentioned in MAMETesters bug 8443 with the Family Basic games.
Also added Family Trainer support to Family Trainer 6 and 10 via the software list.

14266: cpu/i960: Split check_irqs() into two separate functions; fixes MT08347 [gm-matthew]
On the Intel 80960KB, pending interrupts are only checked at the following times (source):
- After returning from an interrupt
- While executing `modpc` if it causes the current priority to be lowered
- After receiving a test pending interrupts IAC message
If pending interrupts are checked during a memory test while it is writing to the same area as the interrupt table, it can result in
  a spurious IRQ with an invalid vector, ultimately causing MAME to crash when the i960 reads an invalid opcode. This is the cause
  of MT08347.
To fix this, `check_irqs()` has been split into two functions: `check_immediate_irqs()` and `check_pending_irqs()`; the latter is
  now only called at the appropriate times.

14277: apple2gs: Improve IRQ emulation  [arekkusu42]
This PR fixes multiple problems with IRQs:
* g65816: fix IRQ to be level triggered
(this one is the impetus for the rest of this PR)
apple2gs in MAME 0.281 does not hang if a programmer \<_raises hand_> makes a error \<_hand still raised_> in an IRQ handler and
  fails to clear the proper IRQ source. This leads to much hair-pulling later, when real hardware hangs.
* apple2gs: improve VGC/MegaII IRQ emulation
There were several subtle errors, which isn't surprising given Apple's scarce documentation. A pile of unit tests revealed exactly
  how each softswitch works.
* apple2gs: implement undocumented MegaII interaction
Reading the MegaII counters clears the VGC's SCB status bit. Strange but true, and inconvenient if you try to measure when SCB IRQs
  occur using VERTCNT...
* apple2gs: improve C019 VBL behavior
The previous change fixed the polarity.  Now it triggers on the proper scanline.
* apple2gs: remove IOUDIS, fix AN3 and paddle
MegaII C046 includes the AN3 state.  Now it matches the DHIRES state.  Also stop triggering the paddle when writing to C071-7D ROM,
  and read the floating bus (verified on hardware.)
Testing:
I wrote a small suite of unit tests to cover all of the above (a lot of comments in the source):
IRQTest_251004.zip
...which exposes many failures in 0.281 (only the first failing subtest of each test is printed):
<img width="704" height="460" alt="IRQTest_0281_before"
  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/625e39fa-15a8-4a22-a089-9fc15f2f12d4" />
Everything passes after this PR, matching hardware behavior verified on an Apple IIgs ROM 3:
!IRQTest_ROM3_pass
Because this touches the 65816 core, I also briefly tested the SNES. A handful of carts (and SA-1 carts) continue to work as well as
  before (which is to say, mostly OK... ctrigger has some graphical errors, and tophant is completely broken.) The NES has good docs
  & homebrew tests for IRQs... the SNES, less so?
Other than saving programmer sanity by making MAME behave the same as real hardware when given a broken IRQ handler, there is no
  obvious user-visible change after this PR. Rastan music continues to play as before.
TODO:
* The 1-sec and quarter-sec IRQ frequency is not verified (hardware does not trigger 1-sec on any particular scanline)
* `adbmicro_p2_out()` only touches a subset of `machine_reset()`, this seems wrong?
* The ZipGS emulation needs to add a slowdown in `raise_irq()`, I have this in a separate WIP PR

14279: g65816: fix status flag display in emulation mode [arekkusu42]
Cosmetic-only change to slightly improve the register display in MAME's debugger.
I also considered changing all of the P flags and E flag to lowercase.  This matches the convention used in "Programming the 65816"
  (Eyes/Lichty), Apple's documentation, and the Apple IIgs Monitor firmware.  Lowercase eliminates some ambiguity (b != B, c != C),
  however the 'E' flag is exposed via MAME's Lua scripting interface, which is case-sensitive, so changing it might break existing
  scripts?

14280: seta/champbwl.cpp: New WORKING clone [sergiopolog]
New WORKING clone
-------------------------------
Doraemon Surotto [hammy]
I added it as parent set as previously dumped one seems to be a prototype. It works on the exact same PCB but no hacks nor external
  wirings are present. https://i.imgur.com/vLPIgh1.jpeg
Sound ROMs are the same but others differ from previous set. I updated file names for these ones according to the labels found on
  this PCB.
The game title for this one is "Doraemon Surotto"  (Doraemon Slot), as seen on the title screen, and some other differences can be
  spotted during gameplay.
Also, DSW settings are different. It uses two banks instead of only 1 and options changed from previous set.
Game freezes when winning, probably due to a bad hopper configuration, but I cannot figure out how to make it work.
Additionally, the game uses 3 different "coin inputs":  "Medal", "¥10" and "¥100" as can be seen in the Service Mode (F2), and I
  assigned `IPT_COIN2`, `IPT_COIN3` and `IPT_COIN4` for them, respectively.  I tried to use `IPT_COIN1` but for some reason, it
  doesn't work (it does nothing).

  0x2C. This commit separates data A and external memory so this no longer occurs.

14288: ef9345: implement commands CLF and CLG [fabio-d]
This PR implements the CLF and CLG commands of the EF9345 and TS9347 video chips. While none of the currently supported Minitel ROMs
  seems to rely on them, they are used in similar Minitel models that we might want to support in the future.
From the EF9435 datasheet, Table 4:
<img width="50%" alt="datasheet" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49e3ff98-fe3c-427b-a264-4e3acdf61372" />
Official documentation about this commands seems quite lacking. A good explanation can be found here:
  https://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?t=22941&start=31
They have been validated with tests `test_clear_page16` and `test_clear_page24` from
  https://github.com/fabio-d/minitel-ef9345-testsuite/blob/main/tests/test_memory.py.
**Implementation notes:**
Unlike all the other commands, CLF and CLG never complete.
More precisely, in the real chip, they keep filling the video RAM in a loop, restarting from line 8 after the last line 31 has been
  filled, until interrupted by the application by executing a different command. CLF/CLG are equivalent to repeatedly executing
  KRF/KRG with proper pointer wraparound.
In this PR, I have made them fill the whole page instantaneously similar to other commands, which are completely "unrolled" in MAME
  and finish immediately as soon as they start.
However, unlike others, CLF/CLG never signal completion by clearing the BUSY flag.

14289: mcs51: fix destination RAM type in XCHD A, @R0/@R1 [fabio-d]
- The initial value is read from internal RAM (IRAM_IR).
- The final value must be written to the internal RAM too (IRAM_IW instead of IRAM_W).
----
I and @jyaif have found an issue in the mcs51's implementation of the `XCHD` ("Exchange Digit") instruction: it reads the old value
  with `IRAM_IR` but writes the new value with `IRAM_W`.
Instead, it should have written the new value symmetrically with `IRAM_IW`:

14307: apple2: cleanup IOUDIS [arekkusu42]
This PR fixes a recent regression, and cleans up IOUDIS:
* apple2e: fix regression in 85e73ca reintroducing #12468
In 0.281, apple2c0 fails the GLU self-test again.  Reverting the RDIOUDIS polarity fixes it, and DGR still works, using examples one
  or two.
* apple2e: IOUDIS and RDDHIRES only exist on the IIc
I did some archeology here, and the TLDR is that Apple copy-pasted wrong information into the IIe Technical References, so everyone
  was confused.  AppleWin has a similar issue open, which I've verified on a physical Apple IIe Enhanced.  But why stop there, when
  we can visualize the entire softswitch range at once:
!Switches_apple2ee_HW
Switches_251013.zip (updated per thread)
This uses carefully controlled floating bus readback to indicate which softswitches (or the low 7 bits) are floating, which on the
  IIe is C020-C08F.  We can see that C07E/7F (and mirrors) are entirely floating, which definitively tells us that RDIOUDIS and
  RDDHIRES don't exist.
Here's 0.281 before this PR (via `apple2ee -gameio ""`, to match my hardware)
<img width="560" height="384" alt="Switches_apple2ee_281_before"
  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2b15908-3d85-4764-b46a-2965aa4e9bd7" />
C078-7F clearly show that only the low 7 bits are floating, which was wrong.
* apple2video: rename dhires_w to reduce confusion
This is merely naming clarification.  I'm not sure if the IIc's RDDHIRES polarity is actually correct, I'm looking for someone to
  test it.
TODO:
* apple2c* allows -gameio compeyes (and it continues to function after this PR), but in reality this is physically impossible to
  connect.
* The SWITCHES test also shows errors with the C05x video softswitches. This happens because the (page2/mixed/lores etc) video mode
  is changed prior to the floating bus read, and gets random data (instead of the controlled HGR black/white.)  On real IIe
  hardware, the video switches are latched with a ~2 cycle delay, after the floating bus readback, and the test is completely
  deterministic (assuming you don't press a key while it is running.)

14313: ef9345: Fix TS9347 font rendering and IND ROM command [fabio-d]
`src/devices/video/ef9345.cpp` supports both the EF9345 and the TS9347 video chips.
- In 40-column mode, unlike the EF9345, the TS9347 does not have dedicated fonts for accented characters. Instead, the bit that on
  the EF9345 would select those fonts is reused for a different purpose (the _i2_ flag, currently unimplemented). Before this
  commit, we were still interpreting this bit as if on the EF9345 and selecting the accented fonts. This commit ensures that the bit
  is ignored both while rendering and in the ROM access command (`IND ROM`).
- In 80-column mode, the TS9347 maps the ranges that the EF9345 would interpret as mosaic characters to a different set of regular
  characters and symbols. This commit ensures we render them correctly.
The new font ROM referenced by the `minitel2` machine (TS9347-based) has been checked with the real hardware.
Links:
- The new `ts9347.bin` font file.
- Tests that were used to validate the rendering and the result of `IND ROM`.
- Script used to generate it, initially from the datasheet and then tweaked until everything matched the output of the chip.

14314: ef9345: Make 80-col mode add margin similarly to 40-col mode [fabio-d]
This commit consists of comments explaining a very subtle detail about a change of coordinates, plus the one minor change described
  below. In the light of this subtle detail, it is apparent that `update_scanline()` has a number of off-by-one issues. I will
  refactor and fix this logic in a separate commit.
The chain of calls that lead to rendering a character is:
- A timer calls `update_scanline` once every 10 lines of pixels. Conveniently, the EF9345 fonts have height = 10 pixels. Therefore,
  each `update_scanline()` call takes care of a full row of text.
- For each character in the row, `update_scanline()` calls `makechar(x, y)`.
- `makechar(x, y)` calls one of the specialized `makechar_NxM(x, y)` functions, depending of the current video mode.
- `makechar_NxM(x, y)` calls one of the even more specialized `bichrome40`/`quadrichrome40`/`bichrome80` (depending on both the
  video mode and the attributes the character).
- `bichrome40`/`quadrichrome40`/`bichrome80` bottom out to either `draw_char_40` or `draw_char_80`.
When `makechar(x, y)` is called, `x` and `y` refer to text coordinates. In other words, `(0, 0)` is the top-left text character.
However, as we go down in the call stack, at some point both coordinates are incremented. In other words, the top-left text
  character is going to be rendered at cell `(1, 1)`. This is so that the left column and the top row stay empty (in fact, they are
  filled with the configured margin color).
Before this commit, the incrementation happened at different stack levels for 40 columns and 80 columns mode: in 40-col mode it
  happened just before calling `draw_char_40`; in 80-col mode it happened just before calling `bichrome80`.
This commit moves the incrementation in 80-col mode so that, coherently to 40-col mode, it happens just before calling
`draw_char_80`.
The rest of the commit simply adds some explanatory comments.
The off-by-one calls to `draw_border` will be fixed in a separate commit.

  could be fixed if min and max were exposed.
If this PR looks OK, I can update the layout scripts to take advantage of it.

14319: sega/model2.cpp: improve interrupt logic [gm-matthew]
- Interrupt control register only returns interrupts actively signalled to the i960; masked interrupts are not returned
- Sound IRQs are triggered when either TxRDY or RxRDY from the USART is active (Model 2B manual, section 6.2)
- Remove model2c_interrupt callback; no evidence that Model 2C behaves any differently to earlier board revisions
- Remove vcop issue from TODO list since it no longer occurs (tested)

14320: Multiple synth layouts: slider scripts use adjuster's min and max instead of assuming the range is 0-100. [m1macrophage]
* **Review can focus on this**: Script in `linn_linndrum.lay` updated to take advantage of #14317.
* The linndrum script was copied to `esq1.lay`, `oberheim_dmx.lay`, `paia_fatman.lay`, `roland_d70.lay` and `roland_tr707.lay`. Note
  that the diffs for some of these look large. That's because they were using older versions of the "reference" script in
  `linn_linndrum.lay`.
* Script in `pg1000.lay` updated accordingly. This had local changes, so didn't just copy the reference.
* Broadened the `inputmask` for sliders and knobs in all layouts, so they can accommodate ranges beyond 0-127.
Related minor fixes:
* `esq1.cpp`: Fixed adjuster defaults to be within range. Defaults were being set to 255, but the adjuster's range was 100, and the
  driver and layout assumed that too.
* `roland_tr707.lay`: Corrected volume slider click area. Also fixes the knob sliding below the cursor when dragged.

14329: For discussion: es550[56] devices generate 20bit samples, not 16-bit ones. [cbrunschen]
This is intended as much for discussion as for potentially merging into MAME.
The Ensoniq ES5506 (OTTO) sound synthesis chip generates 20-bit samples.
See "ENSONIQ OTTO Specification Rev. 2.3" page 14, section "6 THE CHANNEL REGISTERS - page 40hex":
> All the Channel register are 23 bits right justified. The upper three bits are three overflow guard bits.
> The lower 20 data bits are transferred to the serial output register.
See also Figure 16.6 on page 48, "SERIAL INTERFACE TIMING", which shows that the data shifted out on the serial audio data lines are
  the most significant 16 or 18 of the 20 bits in the channel register
The es5506_device code in es5506.cpp correctly generates 20-bit samples, but they are currently added to the audio stream as if they
  were 16-bit samples:
```c++
stream.put_int(c, sampindex, cursample[c], 32768);
```
This results in samples in a range of ±16 rather than ±1. 
While the Ensoniq ES5505 (OTIS) chip does generate 16-bit samples, the es5505_device uses the same code as es5506_device, and thus
  also generates 20-bit samples, again added to the audio stream as if they were 16-bit ones.
The esq_5505_5510_pump_device in esqpump.cpp has always compensated for this by shifting the incoming 20-bit samples from the
  es5505_device right by `SAMPLE_SHIFT` = 4 bits, ever since this was added back when samples were still integers.
I have verified, by logging the incoming samples to the esq_5505_5501_pump_device while playing music on an sd132 (in esq5505.cpp),
  that the samples it receives from the es5505_device are generally in the ±16 range, so this is not just theoretical.
None of this prevents anything from working, but it does mean that the es550[56]_device generated samples are outside of the
  documented tech specs:
> Samples in streams are encoded as sample_t. In the current implementation, this is a float. Nominal values are between -1 and 1
  [...]
Anyone who reads the documentation and then tries to use an es550[56] device would likely be surprised by the sample range they
  would actually encounter. To me, it seems better if the es550[56]_device classes follow the principle of least astonishment and
  add their samples to their output streams in the documented ±1 range.
Another issue is that the current code even generates samples outside the ±16 range - samples which both ES550[56] chips would have
  clamped, see the ES5505 (OTIS) datasheet" page 7, under "Serial Mode Register (SERMODE) -8",
> MSB[4:0] 
> The channel registers are 16 bits with 5 guard bits to prevent overflow during accumulation.
> Since the bus interface is 16 bits, these 5 bits are prevented and are written to the 5 MSB's when a
> channel register is written. If these bits are not either all 0's or all 1's, then overflow has occurred
> and the output will be saturated at either most positive or most negative depending on the state of MSB[4].
and the "ENSONIQ OTTO Specification Rev. 2.3" on page 14, section "6 THE CHANNEL REGISTERS - page 40hex"
> If an overflow or underflow condition is present at the time of transfer to the output, the data is
> saturated to the appropriate rail so that data "wrapping" does not occur.
While the tech specs say that
> clamping at the device level is not recommended (unless that's what happens in hardware of course)
the clamping here does happen in the real hardware, so should be simulated.
That actually also fixes some real observed audio glitches when playing back a demo sequence (`$SD-PALETTE` from the SD-1 Sequencer
  OS 4.10 disk).
Without this PR, so without clamping: without_clamping.wav
With this PR, so including clamping: with_clamping.wav
This PR proposes to address both of these by updating es5506.cpp to add generated samples to the output stream by
```c++
stream.put_int_clamp(c, sampindex, cursample[c], (1 << 19));
```
which not only brings the generated samples from 20-bit integers into the ±1 float range, but also clamps them.
Once the samples are generated in the correct ±1 range, the `SAMPLE_SHIFT` in `esqpump.cpp` can be removed, which this PR also does.
This PR also updates all routes that I was able to find in the codebase of audio from an es550[56]_device  to anything that is _not_
  an esq_5505_5510_pump_device (that one is also being updated to handle the change in sample range), multiplying the route gain by
  16 to compensate for the fact that the generated samples are now a factor of 16 smaller.
This _should_ leave all audio sounding as before. 
I have verified that the VFX family of keyboards (vfx, vfxsd, sd1 and sd132) do in fact sound the same after as before, which makes
  sense, as they use the esq_5505_5510_pump_device and the reduction in the incoming sample range from ±16 is exactly compensated
  for by removing the 4-bit SAMPLE_SHIFT.
However, as I am not familiar with any of the other devices, they should probably be tested by someone who is, to verify that they
  still behave as expected. I may also have missed something, so more and more knowledgeable pairs of eyes would be a great help.
So I hope that this PR can be a starting point for discussion and finding the correct solution, which may of course be something
  completely different than this - or simply accepting the status quo, since it does after all work.

14330: 3rdparty/asmjit: sync with upstream version 1.20 [pmackinlay]

14331: esq5505.cpp: Add VFX-family ROM & EEPROM Cartridge support, and improve floppy support. [cbrunschen]
This adds vfxcart.h and .cpp, which implement a cartridge slot device and a matching cartridge image device.
The VFX also uses DUART input 1 for the cartridge presence, just like the VFX-SD.
This PR also fixes recognition of the floppy drive, so a floppy can now be inserted and read from.
This includes loading the sequencer OS, sound and sequence files, and successfully playing back sequences and songs.
It also tracks the presence of the disk(image) in the floppy drive to synthesize the DSKCHG signal that the (VFS)SD(-1) expects, and
  combines that with the OTIS IRQ to generace the correct DOCIRQ. Similarly it handles the DSEL and MON signals from the keyboard to
  the floppy image.

14333: esq5505.cpp and esqpump.cpp: Route es5505 bus 0 to a separate 'aux' stereo output. [cbrunschen]
The VFX-SD and later keyboards in the family have not only a main stereo output, but also a second 'aux' stereo output that bypasses
  effects processing and has separate output jacks from the keyboard.

14341: esq5505.cpp: Make the VFX family of keyboards' RAM non-volatile. [cbrunschen]
The VFX family of keyboards have a 3V lithium battery that keeps their RAM powered, which makes it effectively non-volatile.
Each has 64 kBytes of OS RAM (2 * 62256 32k x 8 SRAM). The VFX-SD and SD-1 have a base amount of sequencer memory, 64 kB in 2 *
  62256 SRAM chips, mapped 0x330000 .. 0x33ffff.
Both of those can also accommodate the "SQX-70" sequencer memory expansion, which is simply 2 * 621001, 128k x 8 SRAM chips for
  another 256 kB of sequencer RAM, mapped 0x340000 .. 0x37ffff.
The SQX-70 is included by default in the SD-1/32 voice; and it's also included by default in the emulated vfxsd and sd1 devices as
  well as the sd132.
This PR:
- corrects the end address of Sequencer RAM that is mapped in the VFXSD memory map
- adds the device_nvram_interface to the esq5505_state class, but disabled by default
- enabled nvram for the VFX family of devices, in which case it loads and stores:
    - all of OS RAM, 64 kBytes
    - if present, all of Sequencer RAM, 64 + 256 = 320 kByte
   
  for a total of 64 kBytes for the VFX / 384 kBytes for the VFX-SD, SD-1 and SD-1/32

14352: Add support for generating PDB symbols with MinGW clang and lld [cuavas]
This adds a `PDB_SYMBOLS` option for builds to generate CodeView PDB debug information alongside executables.  It has some
  limitations:
* It only works when compiling with clang and linking with lld
* It only makes sense for Windows
* It doesn't check to make sure you only use it when it makes sense (it will just fail to compile if you misuse it)
* I'm not particularly proud of how it's integrated, but it seemed like a low-impact way to do it
This allows source-level debugging MinGW builds in WinDbg, with some caveats:
* MAME will throw a fit if you launch it from WinDbg - you need to start it some other way, then attach to it
* Trying to set breakpoints by source line doesn't seem to work, probably because of all the parent directory references in the
  paths passed to the compiler
* It's a pain to set breakpoints on things in anonymous namespaces because you need to know the generated namespace name
It probably works similarly if you try to debug in Visual Studio, although I haven't tested it (at least not yet).
Anyway, here's a demonstration of attaching to a `SOURCES` build, setting a breakpoint on a function, triggering a breakpoint, and
  stepping by line:

I also got rid of two disabled optimisations for `SYMBOLS` builds:
* We need to force GCC to omit the frame pointer on Windows x86-64 to work around a bug in unwind table generation - in practice
  this option has no effect
* Disabling tail call optimisation has too much impact on releases

14369: Fix round_coordinate behavior for arm64 (fixes Namco System 22 video issues on arm64) [seleuco]
Fix round_coordinate portability and undefined behavior on arm64
The previous implementation of round_coordinate relied on undefined behavior (UB) when casting an out-of-range floating-point value
  (BaseType) to int32_t.
While this might appear to "work" on x86 (often by wrapping around), it produces incorrect results on architectures like arm64,
  which at least fixes weird video issues in Namco System 22 games.
This commit fixes the issue by:
Clamping: Explicitly saturating the input value to INT32_MAX or INT32_MIN before the cast, preventing the UB.
Safe Rounding: Adding a defensive check to prevent overflow if rounding up (from the > 0.5 logic) would push the result past
  INT32_MAX.
This ensures correct, portable behavior across all architectures.

Added support for enabling/disabling hiscore support on a game-by-game basis. 
- Implemented functions to create/save and load exclusion lists in json format
- Updated existing plugin functions to check for a game exclusion before loading / saving high scores
- Updated menu options to enable/disable high-score support per game
I created this update because at least one game - Food Fight (foodf) - crashes upon reload when the existing hiscore plugin is used
  (due to an NVRAM corruption issue).   This made me want to be able to turn the plugin on and off on a per-game basis, however that
  is not possible (it's all-or-nothing).  There are likely other reasons that someone may want to turn off hiscore support for
  certain games.
This update is backward compatible with the existing 1.0.1 plugin; it does not modify its basic functions nor alter any of the
  existing files (json/dat).    This is a drop-in replacement.   Only the init.lua file has been modified.
This plugin update creates new file 'exclude_games.json' which stores the list of games for which hiscore should be disabled.

14388: apple2e: cleanup IIc [arekkusu42]
This PR cleans up more of the Apple IIc:
* apple2e: IIc does not have internal gameio
Before this PR, `mame [apple2c*, las128*] -listslots` shows:
```
apple2c          gameio           compeyes         Digital Vision ComputerEyes
                                  gizmo            HAL Labs Gizmo
                                  joy              Apple II analog joysticks
                                  paddles          Apple II paddles
```
The compeyes and gizmo devices require annunciators; even if they are connected via an adaptor, they can't function on real
  hardware.  This commit applies the existing `joystick_options` from the tk3000 to the IIc (and other Laser clones without internal
  gameio ports.)
* apple2e: remove c000_iic_w()
* apple2e: collapse c000_iic_r()
These two commits remove 200+ lines of copy-paste.  This exposed bugs with unconnected joysticks, Zip Chip registers, and
  RDIOUDIS/RDHIRES side-effect behaviors.  I wrote unit tests, which fail in 0.281:
<img width="560" height="384" alt="PDLTest_apple2c_before"
  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fa5468e-f674-41ae-bf28-7acc9dba9b40" />
PDLTest_251019.zip
After this PR the side-effects match the behavior verified second-hand on IIc hardware:
!PdlTest_apple2cfr_HW
(...but the main motivation for this cleanup is that a future PR is going to add 100 lines of Zip Chip emulation that I would rather
  not copy-paste.)
* apple2e: fix IIc VBL behavior
It looks like this has been broken since MESS integration?  The IIc Technical Ref has wrong information, but it was corrected in
  Apple IIc Technical Note #9.
* apple2e: fix IIc C04x readback
The previous SWITCHES test now more closely matches results from IIc hardware:
!Switches_apple2cfr_HW
* apple2e: remove redundant m_cassette_out
This doesn't affect the IIc, but was noticed by inspection.  Previously, mixing reads and writes to C020, or mixing writes to C020
  and C02X would have behaved strangely on the IIe, because there were two sets of state tracked (and also `m_cassette_out` wasn't
  in the save state.)  Sanity test `LOAD` via `apple2e -cass Choplifter.lo.wav` continues to work.

14390: sega/model2: reduce number of render delegates [gm-matthew]

  required; the checker attribute is instead passed via m2_poly_extra_data. To eliminate any potential performance impact, the value
  of `checker` is only tested at the start of each extent.
Also make `fetch_bilinear_texel()` private as no function outside the `model2_renderer` class needs to use it

14393: qbus: add DVK MFM hard disk controller HLE [shattered]

14395: emu/video: Removed most specialisations of the RGB utilities [cuavas]
I’ve talked with @MooglyGuy about this.  He pointed out that using the SSE2 specialisations of the RGB utilities gives basically no
  performance improvement for Namco System 23 emulation.  I wrote ARM NEON specialisations and found there was no performance
  improvement over the plain C++ implementations there either.
On ARM, some of the reasons were:
* It spends too much time getting data in and out of the vector representation when it effectively works on one pixel at a time with
  packed ARGB8888 input and output.
* To make the most of NEON (or SVE for that matter), you really want to use the structured load/store instructions to get the data
  into planar format (one component for multiple pixels per vector), not the chunky format used here (all components for one pixel
  per vector).
* The compiler isn’t bad at optimising the plain C++ implementation at this point, anyway.
With that background in mind, this PR makes the following changes:
* Cleans up and fully inlines the C++ implementations for all operations apart from bilinear filtering.  This gives the compiler a
  bit for latitude to optimise loops.
* Moves the bilinear filtering out-of-line.  If you do this in a loop, the code will be very hot and remain in the cache anyway, and
  the overhead of accessing the coefficient tables will swamp the call overhead for SSE2 and VMX.
* Adds an ARM NEON bilinear filtering implementation.
* Increases the internal precision of the plain C++ bilinear filtering implementation.

14396: att6300p.cpp: Fix a slew of issues that were found by running the customer diagnostics [donohoe00]
The virtualization hardware is no longer "mainly untested/unverified", but that doesn't guarantee that UNIX / OS Merge will run.

14397: apple: slightly improve Zip Chip emulation [arekkusu42]
I'm going to split my Zip Chip changes into two PRs. This first smaller one fixes problems in the existing implementation, and
  implements two useful status bits:
* apple2gs: fix Zip Chip inconsistencies
The previous PR made the IIc consistent with the IIe, now we do the same for the IIgs.  The IIgs had the same problem as #9503, and
  it was also erroneously re-locking the Zip when disabling via C05A.
* apple: improve Zip Chip C05B
The disable bit allows querying the current state; this is very useful when writing vaporlock beam-racing tests ^\_^;
The delay bit allows measuring delays, which may only be useful to folks trying to write Zip Chip unit tests ^\_^;
These changes have been verified against a ZipGSX in an Apple IIgs ROM3.
The C05B status bit behaviors are described in the 1987 Zip manual (but due to inconsistent documentation I am not implementing bit
  5 in this PR.)
The real annunciator side-effect behavior is more complex, and is handled in a WIP PR.
Testing:
* Total Replay continues to work, enabling the Zip Chip for decompression and disabling for play (or relying on CPS Follow on the
  IIgs.)
* Zip Chip Utilities are unchanged (System Check passes, Cache Diagnostics fail.)
* The ZipGS CDA and CDEV are improved: the initial "Sorry, no ZipGS present"/"No ZipGS detected" error is fixed, and the Misc
  Settings now display accurately.
I also have a WIP test suite verifying all of the remaining softswitches and side-effects, which identifies many failures in 0.281
  _before_ this PR:
<img width="704" height="460" alt="ZIPTEST_apple2gs_before"
  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11526127-645c-4ab0-943a-a26327858cce" />
And a little better _after_ (disabling no longer locks, disable & delay status works, delays can be measured): 
<img width="704" height="460" alt="ZIPTEST_apple2gs_after"
  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd662d3d-5e4c-4084-b2ff-ec8dc74be78a" />
Hardware looks like this:
!ZIPTEST_apple2gs_HW
and with my WIP PR, ZipGS emulation passes all of this. However, I am holding off on that PR until I can locate a volunteer to
  verify the behavior of the the 8-bit Zip Chip in a IIe or IIc+.  (There is enough difference between the Zip Chip and ZipGS that I
  can't just guess at the behavior.)

14403: Plugin documentation:  Update hiscore.rst with plugin configuration details [aaciii]
Updated plugin documentation to cover the new ability to exclude games from the hiscore support.   (This is in support of the
  recently merged #14375)

14404: wozfdc.cpp: improve timing of data register reads [SpecLad]
When one of the even-numbered c08x locations is read, the FDC returns the value of its data register. However, its LSS (logic state
  sequencer) runs fast enough that between when the CPU puts the address on the bus and when it reads the result, it manages to
  complete one cycle. This is explained in _Understanding the Apple II_, page 9-22.
This patch emulates this behavior. Its effect can be seen with the INIT command in DOS 3.2 and earlier. Without the patch, the
  command fails with an I/O error; with the patch, it succeeds. The reason is that it checks if the disk is write-protected after
  formatting every track, so it executes the following instructions while the FDC is in write mode:
    lda $c08d,x
    lda $c08e,x
    bmi error
The way it's supposed to work is:
1. The second LDA instruction switches the FDC to "check write protect" mode.
2. The LSS runs for 1 cycle, which loads the write-protect status into the data register.
3. The data register is copied into A, which puts the write-protect status into the N flag.
4. The BMI instruction tests the status.
Without step 2, the N flag is loaded with whatever was in the high bit of the data register, which seems to be 1 more often than
  not, so DOS thinks the disk is write-protected, and aborts.

14405: Renderer performance improvements for Namco System 23 [MooglyGuy]
This streamlines some of the hotter functions in the System 23 rendering code, mainly:
- Templatizing the scanline-rendering functions
- Eliminating the use of rgbutil.h to remove overheard of unnecessary std::clamp calls and alpha-channel processing (which S23
  lacks)
- Pre-decoding some aspects of the texel ROMs
- Making `render_scanline` and `render_sprite_scanline` member functions of `namcos23_renderer` rather than static functions.
Overall, this takes Panic Park from around 92-94% for an -str 90 run (with the 'Skip POST' DIP set to On), to around 102-104% on my
  AMD Ryzen 9 3950X.

-emu/ioport.cpp: Removed the "optional" field flag. [Vas Crabb]
 * There are multiple issues with this flag:
   - It's poorly defined.  Is it an input that's software-accessible but not used?  Is it an input that shows in test modes but
      doesn't do anything useful?  Is it an input that the system can be configured to not use?  Is it an input that is useful but
      not strictly necessary?
   - In almost a decade, it hasn’t been used widely.  It was used in less than ten places.  There hasn't been substantial interest
      in actually applying it across the codebase.
   - It would be an absolute nightmare to try and apply to mahjong and hanafuda games.  Consider all the cases where a game may use
      some but not all of the double-up game controls, and some games support multiple control schemes that use different subsets of
      the standard mahjong matrix.
   - Trying to apply it to gambling systems would also be a minefield.
   - If we were to expect it to be applied, it would cause an eplosion in input port definitions for platforms with multiple games,
      adding further maintenance burden.  It would greatly reduce the value of having things like the standard mahjong panel
      definitions as you'd rarely actually be able to use them as-is.

-att6300p.cpp: Initial driver for AT&T 6300 Plus (#14149) [donohoe00]
 * cpu/i86/i86.cpp: Avoid clearing working registers upon device reset
   - This change is required in order for BIOS for the AT&T 6300 Plus to work.
   - The 6300 Plus has external logic to reset the 80286 via the reset pin, so that it can return to Real Mode from protected mode.
      Upon return to Real Mode, the BIOS code is clearly depending on the fact that SP register is preserved upon reset (the BIOS
      does however explicitly load the SS register after reset, before it is used).
   - The 8086 and 80286 documentation call out which registers are to be initialized upon reset, and SS is one of them.  For AX, BX,
      CX, DX, BP, SP, SI and DI, the behaviour is not specified.  However, based on what the 6300 Plus BIOS is doing, it appears the
      actual hardware behaviour is to leave them untouched.  Although we can only be fully confident that the real 286 behaves this
      way with respect to the SP register, it's likely that the other registers which do not have explicitly defined initialization
      behavior are also not touched during reset.
   - Note that this observed behaviour only pertains to reset via the reset pin, and not to power-on initialization.

 (#14254) [Christian Brunschen]

-formats/ap2_dsk.cpp: add write support for the D13 format (#14214) [Roman Donchenko]
 * formats/ap2_dsk.cpp: make a2_{13,16}sect_format inherit from a common base class
   - Also, replace hardcoded sector counts by constants and/or variables. There is not much point in the `m_nsect` variable right
      now, but it'll become more useful in a future commit.
 * formats/ap2_dsk.cpp: refactor a2_16sect_format::save
 * extract fragments that would be different for the 13-sector format into separate functions;
 * extract repeated expressions into variables;
 * merge `pos` and `wrap` into a struct;
   - For simplicity of implementation, this makes a minor behavior change: when the current sector is of the wrong DOS version, we
      now start searching for the next sector at the position after the address postamble, rather than after the data preamble (IOW,
      we rewind the current position, which we didn't do before). This shouldn't make much difference in practice.
 * formats/ap2_dsk.cpp: add write support for the D13 format
 * formats/ap2_dsk.cpp: group methods by class

-formats/ap2_dsk.cpp: remove the RWTS18 format (#14262) [Roman Donchenko]
 * It is completely non-functional. The loading code is commented out, and the saving code crashes, because it attempts to access 70

 * The code has been in this state ever since it's been added in 36ea482a, so it seems unlikely that it'll improve. Moreover, its
    utility seems questionable: I haven't been able to find a single floppy image with an .rti extension (and there are none listed
    in the software list). OTOH, for every game mentioned in the description, there are WOZ images that can be used instead (except
    for The Toy Shop, which has DSK images).

-bus/qbus: Get DVK card implementation detals out of headers. [Vas Crabb]

-g65816: fix status flag display in emulation mode (#14279) [arekkusu42]
 * In emulation mode, "MX" are " B".  Both bits are always 1, only the semantic meaning changes: " " doesn't exist, and "B" is only
    meaningful when pushed during an IRQ/NMI, to distinguish from BRK.
 * No functional change.

-apple2gs: Improve IRQ emulation  (#14277) [arekkusu42]
 * g65816: fix IRQ to be level triggered
   - Followup b3f2535: stop clearing LINE_IRQ when jumping to the IRQ vector. Properly written IRQ handlers won't notice any
      difference, but this fixes the behavior for software which (possibly intentionally) fails to clear an IRQ source; in that case
      the IRQ should continue to trigger (probably leading to a system hang.)
   - LINE_SO is generally not hooked up, but if it is, it doesn't raise IRQ.
   - Also delete unused G65816_INT_* macros.
 * apple2gs: improve VGC/MegaII IRQ emulation
   - All of the VGC and MegaII IRQ sources set their status bits even when the corresponding IRQ is not enabled (this was only
      implemented for SCB).
   - Clearing enable bits works differently between VGC and MegaII: the MegaII can lower the IRQ line (when all sources are clear),
      the VGC does not. Neither clears their corresponding status bits.
   - VGCINTCLEAR reads the floating bus.  Status bits (and IRQs) are only cleared when writing a zero.
   - ADB reset needs to clear (at least) m_irqmask.
   - Also cleanup CLRVBLINT into do_io().
 * apple2gs: implement undocumented MegaII interaction
   - Reading the C02E/C02F counters resets the SCB status bit in C023 (the same as writing to C032).
   - This behavior is not documented by Apple, but was verified on hardware.
   - Move the relevant logic into a helper, to avoid code duplication.
 * apple2gs: improve C019 VBL behavior
   - Ensure that VBL is cleared on scanline 0 and set on scanline 192, even in SHR.
 * apple2gs: remove IOUDIS, fix AN3 and paddle
   - Followup 6a4854b: IOUDIS only exists on the IIc and IIc+.
   - AN2/3 are set by ROM during boot, and AN3 is readable via C046.
   - Also followup 23904ff: paddle only triggers on r/w of C070, and it reads the floating bus.
 * apple2gs: reduce do_io() log spam
   - 16-bit writes in demos were tripping "unknown switch".
   - No functional change.
 * apple2gs: update stale link

-ef9345: Fix TS9347 font rendering and IND ROM command (#14313) [Fabio D'Urso]
 * ef9345.cpp supports both the EF9345 and the TS9347 video chips.
   - In 40-column mode, unlike the EF9345, the TS9347 does not have dedicated fonts for accented characters. Instead, the bit that
      on the EF9345 would select those fonts is reused for a different purpose (the i2 flag, currently unimplemented). Before this
      commit, we were still interpreting this bit as if on the EF9345 and selecting the accented fonts. This commit ensures that the
      bit is ignored both while rendering and in the ROM access command (IND ROM).
   - In 80-column mode, the TS9347 maps the ranges that the EF9345 would interpret as mosaic characters to a different set of
      regular characters and symbols. This commit ensures we render them correctly.
     * The new font ROM referenced by the minitel2 machine (TS9347-based) has been checked with the real hardware.

-Added emulation of a CEM3320-based 4th-order LPF, and used it on the linndrum.  (#14264) [m1macrophage]

 * IRQ handling for audio engine rewritten to remove 10.3 magic number and to derive from the sequencer rate only:
 * Balls now line up perfectly on popira towards the end of the song.
 * No more re-syncs between CPU and audio engine in hikara, which caused a lumbering feel to the music on each resync.
 * Sequencer rate calculated from hardware behaviours.
 * WM1 (Noise Generator) corrected to better reflect hardware.
 * Various envelope logic bugs fixed.
 * Implement capacity limit for mixer with hardware accurate voice clipping.
 * Implement DAC broadcast and multiplex mixer modes.
 * Simplified pitch-bend stepping logic.
 * WM0 waves are now read from RAM, as they are CPU modifiable.
 * Gain calculations adjusted to avoid clipping on worst case titles.
 * Lots of clean-up, de-duplication, better naming, and correctness fixes.
 * Detailed logging put in place.
 * Annotations added.
 * Use BIT helpers.

   - `sonic3` "fram" area doesn't exist anymore, use "sram" instead;
   - Retire `rom_radica` from legacy handling: it has been moved as standalone sega/megadriv_rad.cpp driver starting from #3108
   - Retire `rom_topf` from legacy handling: was a broken version of `rom_lion3`;

-apple2e: cleanup IIc (#14388) [arekkusu42]
 * apple2e: IIc does not have internal gameio
   - Followup #14307: the IIc (and clones based on this form factor) do not have an internal 16-pin gameio port, and the
      annunciators are not routed to the external joystick connector, thus devices such as gizmo and compeyes can't work.
 * apple2e: remove c000_iic_w()
   - Only C078-7F have IIc-specific behavior.  Handle them in common c000_w, to reduce copy-paste.  Three functional changes:
 * Zip Chip C058-5F now work in a non-plus IIc
 * Zip Chip C058-5F now side-effect annunciators on the IIe
 * C07X now side-effect paddle timers and VBL interrupt on the IIc
 * apple2e: collapse c000_iic_r()
   - Following the pattern of c000_laser_r(), reduce c000_iic_r() to the minimum set of IIc-specific softswitches and rely on
      c000_r() for the rest.  Three functional changes:
 * unconnected joysticks now read properly (8021d6b missed the IIc)
 * Zip Chip C05B now works the same on the IIc and the IIe
 * RDIOUDIS/RDDHIRES now side-effect paddle timers and VBL interrupt
 * apple2e: fix IIc VBL behavior
   - C019 on the IIc behaves quite differently than the IIe or IIgs; it does not signify that the beam is in VBL, rather it
      signifies that a VBL IRQ has fired.  This happens when the beam reaches VBL, but only if C05B ENVBL is set, and C019 remains
      set until manually cleared via accessing C07X.  This is similar to how C041 and C047 work on the IIgs.
   - Also fix a logic error in laser_mouse_r() breaking VBL polling.
 * apple2e: fix IIc C04x readback
   - Fix C04x to return the floating bus in the low 7 bits, matching behavior verified on hardware.
 * apple2e: remove redundant m_cassette_out
   - C020 now works identically reading or writing, the same as apple2.

Mephisto (set 1) [Berger]

-Update hiscore.rst with plugin configuration details (#14403) [aaciii]
 * Updated plugin documentation to cover the new ability to exclude games from the hiscore support.

-wozfdc.cpp: improve timing of data register reads (#14404) [Roman Donchenko]
 * When one of the even-numbered c08x locations is read, the FDC returns the value of its data register. However, its LSS (logic
    state sequencer) runs fast enough that between when the CPU puts the address on the bus and when it reads the result, it manages
    to complete one cycle. This is explained in Understanding the Apple II, page 9-22.
 * This patch emulates this behavior. Its effect can be seen with the INIT command in DOS 3.2 and earlier. Without the patch, the
    command fails with an I/O error; with the patch, it succeeds. The reason is that it checks if the disk is write-protected after
    formatting every track, so it executes the following instructions while the FDC is in write mode:
 * lda $c08d,x lda $c08e,x bmi error
 * The way it's supposed to work is:
 * 1. The second LDA instruction switches the FDC to "check write protect" mode. 2. The LSS runs for 1 cycle, which loads the
    write-protect status into the data register. 3. The data register is copied into A, which puts the write-protect status into the
    N flag. 4. The BMI instruction tests the status.
 * Without step 2, the N flag is loaded with whatever was in the high bit of the data register, which seems to be 1 more often than
    not, so DOS thinks the disk is write-protected, and aborts.

-apple: slightly improve Zip Chip emulation (#14397) [arekkusu42]
 * apple2gs: fix Zip Chip inconsistencies
   - Followup #9503: fix the ZipGS enable/disable to work correctly, and not re-lock.  Also properly initialize the paddle delay,
      which has been verified against hardware to work the same way as the Zip Chip documentation (not reversed.)  Also consistently
      side-effect the annunciators.
   - This fixes errors visible in the ZipGS CDA/CDEV.
 * apple: improve Zip Chip C05B
   - Implement the disable and delay status bits.  Now software can detect the current enable state of the Zip, so the user's
      boot-time preference can be restored, instead of blindly enabling or disabling.
