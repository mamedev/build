disassembler [Lord Nightmare]

Cosmic: fixed cosmica2 romset rom split and names to match romset as 
described in mameinfo, which it matches (except for one rom which 
mameinfo is probably wrong about). The romset uses a different rom 
daughterboard to the other cosmica romsets, and different sized roms.
[Lord Nightmare]

[Atari Ace]

PCB documentation updates: [Kevin Eshbach]
 * Added the board xtal's for Battlantis, Contra and Pandora's Palace
 * Corrected the MCU dump for Pandora's Palace
 * Added indication of an undumped PAL for Contra/Gryzor
 * Added PAL dumps for Cruis'n USA - rev L4.1
 * Added information on the PROM from the 2 Board version of Congo 
    Bongo

Noraut Poker driver improvements: [Roberto Fresca]
 * Added new technical notes.
 * Added Kimble Z80 hardware support.
 * Added Prologic-Noraut hardware support.
 * Added proper discrete sound support to Kimble games,
   and Prologic-Noraut Joker Poker.
 * Slightly adjusted the visual area.
   This can be wrong and must be rechecked.
 * Relocated the hardware notes and layouts to ROM_LOAD section,
   so can be seen/maintained in a cleaner way.
 * Fixed the default lamps state.

Cleaned-up several drivers; added missing prototypes and removed dead 
ones, marked non-exported functions as static and removed cases of 
#include "deprecat.h" [Atari Ace]

Aleck 64: Implemented player 2 inputs [Angelo Salese]

Added a PCB layout for M.Kramer's Black Jack Poker, based on a hi-res 
pic. Also added undumped devices as NO_DUMP. [Roberto Fresca]

Added common driver data struct to timeplt.c, tutankhm.c, junofrst.c, 
pooyan.c, rallyx.c and rocnrope.c (these drivers all use 
audio/timeplt.c). As a side effect, we now have save states in 
junofrst.c and rallyx.c. [Fabio Priuli]

Converted atari drivers over to using driver_data for the most
part. Some shared systems still exist with globals, but this
tackles the atarigen module and the variables local to each
driver. [Aaron Giles]

Added validity check that AM_BASE_MEMBER and AM_SIZE_MEMBER items 
point within the bounds of the driver_data structure. [Aaron Giles]

 * Fixed EIP displacement when executing FPU instructions with no 
    80387 present
 * Added 32-bit implementations of SLDT and STR

Converted Kaneko Pandora sprite chip to be a MAME device and updated 
drivers accordingly. [Fabio Priuli]

Added tilemap_create_device() function which lets you create a tilemap
from within a device, and be passed that device in your callback.
[Aaron Giles]

Converted Signetics 2636 video chip to be a MAME device and updated 
drivers using it accordingly. [Fabio Priuli]

Memory system changes: [Aaron Giles]
 - Memory banks are now referenced by tag rather than index.
    Changed all memory_bank_* functions to specify a tag.
    Bulk-converted existing banks to be tagged "bank##" in
    order to ensure consistency. However, going forward, the
    tags don't matter, so please name them something useful.

 - Added AM_BANK_READ/AM_BANK_WRITE macros to let you specify
    bank tags. Also changed AM_ROMBANK and AM_RAMBANK macros to
    accept tags as well.

 - Added new functions memory_install_read_bank_handler and
    memory_install_write_bank_handler to install banks by tag
    name, similar to input ports.

 - Changed internals of memory system to dynamically allocate
    all banks. The first time a bank with an unknown tag is
    installed, a new bank object is created and tracked 
    internally.

 - Removed SMH_* macros entirely. In their place are a series of 
    expanded macros and new memory installation helpers. Some 
    mappings below (not all are new):

     AM_READ(SMH_RAM)                       -> AM_READONLY
     AM_WRITE(SMH_RAM)                      -> AM_WRITEONLY
     AM_READWRITE(SMH_RAM, SMH_RAM)         -> AM_RAM
     AM_READ(rhandler) AM_WRITE(SMH_RAM)    -> AM_RAM_READ(rhandler)
     AM_READ(SMH_RAM) AM_WRITE(whandler)    -> AM_RAM_WRITE(whandler)
     AM_DEVREAD(tag, rhandler) AM_WRITE(SMH_RAM) 
                                  -> AM_RAM_DEVREAD(tag, rhandler)
     AM_READ(SMH_RAM) AM_DEVWRITE(tag, whandler) 
                                  -> AM_RAM_DEVWRITE(tag, whandler)

     AM_READ(SMH_ROM)                       -> AM_ROM
     AM_WRITE(SMH_ROM)                      -> (was a no-op)

     AM_READ(SMH_NOP)                       -> AM_READNOP
     AM_WRITE(SMH_NOP)                      -> AM_WRITENOP
     AM_READWRITE(SMH_NOP, SMH_NOP)         -> AM_NOP

   For dynamic memory handler installation of the various types,
   use the new functions:

     memory_unmap_read()
     memory_unmap_write()
     memory_unmap_readwrite() -- unmaps a section of address space

     memory_nop_read()
     memory_nop_write()
     memory_nop_readwrite() -- nops a section of address space

 - Cleaned up the internals of the address_map_entry structure, and
    also normalized the way the address map macros work to remove a
    lot of redundancy.

 - Renamed functions: memory_install_read/write_port_handler to
    memory_install_read/write_port

 - Memory shares are now specified by tag instead of index.
    The AM_SHARE() macro now takes a tag parameter. All existing
    shares have been bulk renamed to "share##". However, the name
    does not matter, so please use descriptive tags going forward.

 - Added tag validation for bank and share tags.

 - Added flag to tagmap_add functions that optionally will
    replace existing objects if a duplicate is found.

 - Internal code shuffling. Address maps initialized internally
    now call the same installation handlers that drivers do for 
    dynamic installation. Cleaned up some parameter ordering and 
    error detection.

 - Added new functions:

     memory_install_ram() to assign a un-named bank to a region and 
       specify a pointer to where the RAM lives. If this is called in 
       the DRIVER_INIT function or MACHINE/SOUND/VIDEO_START 
       functions, then it is permissible to specify NULL, in which 
       case the memory system will allocate memory and register it 
       for save states.

     memory_install_rom() is like the above except that it only 
       installs a read handler.

     memory_install_writeonly() is like the above except that it 
     only installs a write handler.

 - Updated several instances in the code that were assigning banks 
    to these sorts of static RAM regions and simplified the code.

 - Apply mirrors and global masks at address map detokenizing time 
    rather than later.
