11801: heathkit/h89.cpp: Add SigmaSoft Interactive Graphics Controller [mgarlanger]
Adds the SigmaSoft and Systems Interactive Graphics Controller (IGC) device for the H89 computer. 
Unlike the other graphics upgrades for the Heath H19 which had all the changes/connections in the H19 (or the terminal portion of
  the H89), this board connected to the H89's CPU board and it's the CPU board's Z80 which drives the graphics board.  Note: the IGC
  could also work with Heath H8 and H19, but in that configuration, the H8's CPU would still be controlling the IGC, not the TLB.
I'm not sure this is the best way to structure the code. This IGC can be used with some of the alternate ROMs on the TLB board, such
  as Super19, UltraROM, and Watzman, in addition to the original Heath ROM. If there is a clean way to allow any of these ROM with
  the IGC, that would be preferred to this approach.

11988: rm/rm380z.cpp: Fix vram access to allow reading of character data from screen [RobinSergeant]
As noted in https://mametesters.org/view.php?id=6484 the first character of the "Disc not ready" error message went missing when
  trying to boot from the monitor without a disc.  The message was written correctly, but then corrupted because it was not possible
  for the firmware to read character data back from the screen.  rm380z_state::videoram_read() always returned the last byte written
  to a (row,col) which was usually the attributes of a character rather than the character itself :-)  This lead to some sort of bug
  in the firmware where it would overwrite the "D" character with zero.
I've updated rm380z_state::videoram_read()  so that it returns the requested data (either a character or it's attributes) and the
  error message now displays correctly.  While doing this I've also tidied up the vram storage so that it just uses two 2d arrays
  which seems to mirror the actual hardware from reading the documentation (it had separate banks of RAM for character data and
  attributes).  This is also more efficient and make the code easier to read.
Unfortunately, I don't have any software for the machine but I wrote a quick assembler program to help debug and test the issue:
```
VTOUT:  equ 0x37
VTIN:   equ 0x38
KBDW:   equ 0x21
WIDTH:  equ 0x34
emt: macro routine
rst 0x30
defb routine
endm
org 0x100
ld a, 0x00		; set 40 character mode (use 0x01 for 80 column mode)
emt WIDTH
ld a, 'A'		; Write 'A' with underline attribute to position (4,4)
ld hl, 0x0404	
ld e, 0x02
emt VTOUT
emt VTIN		; Read back character and attributes from position (4,4)
push af
emt KBDW		; wait for keypress
pop af
```
Before my change both the A and E registers contained 0x02 (the underline attribute) after running the program.  Now A contains the
  character ('A').
The program can be assembled on Linux using z80asm and then loaded using the MAME debugger.  To run start the 380Z front panel by
  pressing (Ctrl + F) and then enter j followed by 100.
It looks like there are other bugs in the driver so I will try to improve it further when time allows.  It would also be nice to get
  the 480z driver to work (it's currently completely broken).

11995: cpu/t11: add basic support for K1801VM1 [shattered]

11996: apple/apple2e.cpp: update LC memory map when LC state changes [xotmatrix]
It appears that during a reset, the expected and executed language card state changes do not also update the system memory map. This
  can cause a reset vector to fail when the language card RAM has been banked over ROM. The following software hangs when reset is
  asserted:
Merlin running from 32 Meg Hard Drive Image
BBC Basic running from Applecorn
A reset hang can be demonstrated from a clean boot by entering the following code into the monitor. It banks in the LC over ROM and
  waits for the user to press reset. If the LC bank is uninitialized and reset is pressed, it will hang in a cascade of `BRK`
  instructions.
```
*300: 2C 80 C0 4C 03 03 N 300G
```
The Apple //c will hang a little differently since it copies an IRQ/BRK vector into the LC RAM area when it boots. The interrupt
  service routine will attempt to jump to a ROM location but it isn't banked in, a `BRK` will be hit, and the routine will be
  triggered again.
I must stress that I don't fully understand how memory mapping works. I copied the pattern seen in parts of the code, consolidated
  it into a function `lcrom_update()`, and inserted calls to it wherever the language card state changed. These changes resolve the
  reset vector problems but someone wiser than me should review what I've done carefully. The `ALTZP` softswitch affects the
  language card area but I gather changes to `m_altzp` followed by a call to `auxbank_update()` bank AUX memory into the LC RAM area
  automatically (though it is not explicitly stated).
A true slot 0 language card in an early model Apple II does not change its state when reset so this has been left alone. According
  to Jeff Mazur there is no hardware reset of `m_romswitch` and the extended ROM code supports that so that has not been changed. I
  don't know enough about the CEC computers to comment and have tried to leave its LC mapping undisturbed.

11999: nec/pce.cpp, nec/pce_cd.cpp: Various updates [cam900]

Added official Heath software programs for the H88 cassette interface. These programs were originally written for the H8 and it's

12031: rm/rm380z.cpp: Use real character ROM for COS 4.0, correct screen resolution and add support for user defined characters
  [RobinSergeant]
I've managed to obtain a dump of the real character ROM for COS 4.0 courtesy of the Research Machines user group, and this PR pulls
  this in and updates the display code to use it.
What is the correct process for updating a rom set?  This my working version that includes the new character rom:
rm380z.zip
The real characters are actually larger than the fake set we used before (8x10 rather then 5x9) and even include 2 extra rows to be
  used when the underline attribute is set.  This all makes the display handling much easier and improves the display greatly.
So with these characters 80 column mode has a display resolution of 640x240 and 40 column mode uses 320x240.
For COS 3.4 I've set the display resolution to 240x240 which I think is correct because COS 3.0 only supported the VDU40 adaptor
  which uses the TI 74LS262 character ROM.  These characters are 5x9, padded to 6x10 for display.  It's a shame we don't have the
  real ROM for this as well, but at the moment I'm concentrating on getting COS 4.0 to work properly anyway!
The new ROM only includes characters 0x00 to 0x79 because the additional teletext characters (0x80 to 0xFF) are actually generated
  by COS as user defined characters.  I've also added support for user defined characters so that these continue to work.
This PR includes all my changes for HW scrolling from the last PR which is still in review
  (https://github.com/mamedev/mame/pull/12014), but I don't want to close that until the review comment has been cleared.  I can do
  any further re-work under this PR.

12034: sound/discrete.cpp: Use appropriate memory barriers for task synchronisation [cuavas]
The synchronisation barriers used in the discrete sound device aren’t really thought out properly.  There are two variable where
  concurrent accesses matter:
* `output_buffer::ptr`, used to determine the number of samples available to the consumer.
* `discrete_task::m_threadid`, used to ensure only a single thread runs a given task at any given time.
Using the `volatile` qualifier for `output_buffer::ptr` doesn’t really help, as it doesn’t enforce ordering between writes to the
  buffer and writes to the pointer itself.  The pointer itself needs to be updated with release semantics, while it needs to be read
  with acquire semantics when determining how many samples are available to the consumer.
`discrete_task::m_threadid` needs to be updated with acquire semantics when locking and release semantics when unlocking to ensure
  no work gets reordered outside the critical section.  It’s a bad idea to use `compare_exchange_weak` when locking as it isn’t in a
  loop attempting to complete a lock-free operation.  On x86 you’ll never notice the difference, but on most other architectures it
  can fail on contention for a cache line, which isn’t what we want to happen here.
`discrete_task` seems to use `public`/`protected`/`private` randomly, and doesn’t need a vtable as it’s never used as a base class.
This may or may not fix #11373, but I don’t like having dodgy synchronisation code around that works by chance at best.

12050: machine/z80scc.cpp: Added support for RTxC transmit/receive clock source [colinleroy]
Fixes serial emulation at 115200bps.
This leaves some things unimplemented (like TRxC and DPLL clock sources), but makes programs communicating at 115.200bps function
  properly.
For context, toggling this chip to 115200bps or 230400bps is done by
1) setting the clock multiplier to 16 (230400bps) or 32 (115200bps), WR4 bits 6 or 7
2) setting the clock source for TX and RX to /RTxC instead of BRG, WR11
3) stopping the baud rate generator, WR14 bit 0
I hope this is a good first PR.
Thanks!

12057: util/bitstream: Fix cases where bits would be dropped when reading and writing [987123879113]
Additional testing from someone else before merging would be appreciated.
In this case, the parent chunk types were using 26 bits per offset values which behaved unexpectedly resulting in some bits being
  dropped when reading and writing the data. I think the issue only happens when dealing with values larger than 24 bits due to the
  way buffering was implemented. So I've changed both `bitstream_in` and `bitstream_out` to more greedily fill its buffers,
  including partial reads for `bitstream_in`.
Old (can see an additional CRC error message I added to help debug, should be reproducible):

12060: util/bitstream: Adjust m_doffset based on m_dbitoffs when flushing [987123879113]
Found that in addition to forgetting to clear `m_dbitoffs` when flushing resulting in data being shifted incorrectly after a flush
  when `m_dbitoffs` was non-0, the variable `m_doffset` would go out of sync after flushing when `m_dbitoffs` was used so that
  needed to be adjusted as well.
I've tested with `chdman info` to check that the 175 CHDs I have on hand can still decompress the map data still, recreated the
  delta CHD (`chdman copy -i ~/chd_test/gdj_aaa_2007071100.chd -op ~/chd_test/gdj_aaa_2007100800.chd -o ~/chd_test/newchild5.chd`)
  and verified that all of the hashes validated, and then did various tests using the `dlair` laserdisc CHD including extracting
  using `chdman extractld`, recreating using `chdman createld`, and verifying that the SHA1 and Data SHA1 were the same in the
  original CHD and the recreated CHD.
