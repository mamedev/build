Source Changes

Change DirectInput joystick acquisition method to be non exclusive.
[bdam]

toaplan2.c: Correct the video (character layer) offset for 1945 Part-2
(Chinese hack of Battle Garegga) [Dave Haywood]

dc: Fix the maple hookup and controllers and add the missing maple irq
[O. Galibert]

galaxia.c: Improved colors and hooked up cvs stars circuit. [hap]

Hooked up TMS9928 and PIA devices to Baby Pac-Man video CPU, gives
some gfx if you press the service switch [Angelo Salese]

pgm.c: Continued refactoring of the protections, including improved
notes.  Moved some code into the states and split states by protection
type.  [David Haywood]

Set the correct cpu in mpu5.c driver and split a few alternate
revisions into clone sets.  [David Haywood]

Decrypted the rest of the gambling sets in igs_m027.c.  No further
advancements in visible emulation to report, though.  [iq132]

Redumped sound roms in funcube2 and funcube3 [Guru, Yasuhiro Ogawa]

Improved irqs in Little Robin, and added preliminary sound to it
[Angelo Salese]

model2.c: Added the I/O Controller rom (Z80 based) for Rail Chase 2
[Brian Troha, The Dumping Union]

Converted gamtor.c to use VGA device (doesn't work though due of a
weird banking problem) [Angelo Salese]

m68k: add preliminary on-board peripherals to 68307 and 68340
[David Haywood]

SDL: Fix formatting of chdman man page [wallyweek]

Allow compilation with compatible system-installed versions of libjpeg
and libflac [wallyweek, R. Belmont]

Solved the remaining issues with Raiden 2's sprite decryption.
[Andreas Naive]

Major driver modernization changes [Miodrag Milanovic]
- Added 4th parameter to all address maps
- Added missing state classes
- Removed ADDRESS_MAP_MODERN define

rastan.c: Add dipswitch locations to the Rastan sets. [Brian Troha]

namcos21.c: Added Namco game prefix to the Winning Run 91 set. Added
minor documentation about the System21B two board stack. [Brian Troha]

nmk16.c: Fixes some issues and cleaned up the video sources a bit
[trap15]

Fixed ymf271.c core timer allowing for greater accuracy. [Sonikos]

BFM Scorpion 4 Hardware:  [David Haywood]
 * General update which fleshes out some of the 68307 code (not 100%
    correct hookups, just improved logging and enough to get us
    somewhere).
 * Added various devices to the SC4 emulation, added a default layout
    showing the VFD, to which most of the earlier games will now write
    'Initializing'.  Timers and other devices still need to be
    implemented properly before they actually initialize.
 * Put the actual SC4 hardware emulation in drivers/bfm_sc4h.c so that
    it doesn't get lost in the swamp of sets (scrolling through a file
    is quite hard when it's almost entirely set definitions)

mirax, miraxa (mirax.c) [stephh] :
 * Fixed Dip Switches and Inputs (after verification of the Z80 code)

Implemented flip screen support to Mirax [Angelo Salese]

galdrvr.c: Added preliminary protection emulation to Monster Zero.
[hap]

Moved all drivers to using the paletteram helpers defined in the
driver_device base class. The palette base is now specified via an
AM_SHARE of "paletteram" or "paletteram2". The driver_device base
class now finds these pointers and places them in
m_generic_paletteram_8/_16/_32 and m_generic_paletteram2_8/_16/_32.
[Aaron Giles]

Removed machine.generic.paletteram*, and machine.generic entirely.
Removed AM_BASE_GENERIC/AM_SIZE_GENERIC as they don't apply anymore.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed required_/optional_shared_ptr to support set_target with base
and size for manually configuring a shared pointer, and a new allocate
method for dynamically allocating (and registering the memory for save
states). [Aaron Giles]

Converted memory_private to memory_manager and moved global memory
operations into methods on it. Converted the less-popular cases over
in drivers that used them, leaving the bank management APIs global for
now. [Aaron Giles]

Add logic to ensure that shared pointers are checked to be of the
right width. The primary upshot is that if you declare
AM_SHARE("paletteram") in an 8-bit memory map, then only
m_generic_paletteram_8 will be populated, and m_generic_paletteram_16
will be NULL. But it applies to all required_/optional_shared_ptrs
declared, so make sure they are of the right type. [Aaron Giles]

Added code to cdrom.c to compute and verify ECC codes for mode 1/2
sectors. [David Haywood]

Added CD compressor template which separates subcode data from sector
data, removes redundant ECC data prior to compression, and uses
separate compressors for each part. Defined LZMA and ZLib CD
compressors based on this and made them the default for CDs.
[Aaron Giles]

Redumped sprites rom of lhzb2 [Guru]

Decrypted sprites in lhzb. Decrypted tiles and palette in lhzb2 and
slqz2. Added inputs and memory maps in these games, pending protection
simulation [Luca Elia]

Move driver list/enumerator to new file drivenum.c/.h. Move
game_driver definition and constants to new header gamedrv.h. [Aaron
Giles]

wldarrow.c: Added service inputs, allowing battery RAM to be
initialized in test mode, making the games close to playable. [hap]

namcos10: Fix banking for Mr. Driller 2, first stab at the encryption
[O. Galibert]

misc sc4/68307 updates + prelim peripheral hookups, allows most sc4
sets to run their sound rom checks [David Haywood]

rastan.c: Cleaned up Parent/Child order. Corrected ROM names and added
additional information / notes. [Brian Troha]
