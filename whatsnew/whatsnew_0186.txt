-Wide-ranging modernisation/cleanup: [Vas Crabb]
 * Moved static data (short name, full name, source file) out of devices and into device types.
 * Moved state class out of MACHINE_CONFIG_START, eliminating need for MACHINE_CONFIG_FRAGMENT and MACHINE_CONFIG_DERIVED_CLASS.
 * Made game drivers add machine configuration in the same way as any other device.
 * Added support for machine configuration in device members, allowing many internal handlers to be made protected or private.
 * Moved many constants used internally by devices out of headers and into source files.
 * Converted many constants to scoped enums, and reduced scope of many constants and types.
 * Made many callback setters forward the parameter
 * Cleaned up many names that are reserved because they begin with _[A-Z] or contain two consecutive underscores.
 * Gave many devices more descriptive names, and renamed some device types and classes with overly generic names.
 * Untangled fantasy sound and Microprose 3D noise from the driver state classes.
 * Converted DECO BSMT2000 ready callback from a function pointer to a device delegate.
 * Made many devices use object finders for subdevices rather than doing tagmap lookups later.
 * Started to disentangle TI-99 from TI-990 and organised stuff by bus type.
 * Made some TI-99 buses use slot/card interfaces properly.
 * Turned some of the FM, SID, SCSP DSP, EPIC12 and Voodoo cores into idiomatic C++.
 * Factored out some boilerplate for YM chips with PSG.
 * Made Z180 table allocation/setup a bit safer.
 * Improved encapsulation of Z80DART channels and SNES PPU.
 * Converted generic keyboard and terminal to use a device delegate rather than WRITE8 since space/offset/mask aren't relevant.
 * Made terminal device dynamically allocate buffer so derived devices (e.g. teleprinter) can specify size.
 * Started to break out common parts of Samsung ARM SoC devices.
 * Consolidated and de-duplicated forward declarations in src/emu, and removed some obsolete ones.
 * Added #include guards to many headers that were missing them, and made many existing ones consistent.
 * Removed rarely used output and PTY interfaces from emu.h prefix header.

-Improvements to auxiliary verbs: [Vas Crabb]
 * Added support for device sets to -listroms (e.g. mpu401 or m68705p3).
 * Added support for multiple names/patterns to -listroms, -verifyroms and -listxml.
 * Added check that device short names don't exceed 32 characters in -validate.
 * Made -listxml instantiate slot devices as children of slots rather than the root device.
 * Improved performance of device type walk by at least two thirds.
