MAMETesters Bugs Fixed
----------------------
- 03470: [Crash/Freeze] backfirea: Game mode setting error on startup 
         (Fabio Priuli)
- 03465: [Crash/Freeze] batrid, bgaregga, bkraidu and clones: Reset after 
         rom check (R. Belmont)
- 03463: [DIP/Input] kingball, kingballj: Wrong coinage DIP options. 
         (Tafoid)



Source Changes
--------------
Multifish driver update [MetalliC]
 - Hooked up RTC (real time clock)
 - Added documentation about backdoor / bootleg / hacks

Space Encounter - fixed enemy shot sound. [Derrick Renaud]

Space Walk - started Springboard Miss sound. [Derrick Renaud]

Added color prom to Omega. [Andy Welburn]

m68k updates: [R. Belmont]
 - throw F-line trap correctly when PMMU instructions are hit on 
    non-equipped CPUs.
 - Added working PMMU address translation (not feature complete, but 
    sufficient to boot several 68030 Macs in MESS)
 - Fixed up disassembly of some PMMU instructions
 - Added "68020 with 68851" CPU type

Added correct 64Mb CROM dumps to spikeout. [Phil Bennett]

Added EXPECTED macro to complement the already existing UNEXPECTED
macro. [couriersud]

Discrete update [couriersud]
 - fix some "const" weirdness I introduced
 - fix VREF in CRFILTER_VREF and RCFILTER_VREF. VREF never got used 
    since it was only a static parameter.
 - Removed enable from CR_FILTER* and RC_FILTER*
 - Updated drivers accordingly.
 - Use EXPECTED/UNEXPECTED to help the compiler

DISCRETE_CRFILTER, DISCRETE_RCFILTER updates: [Derrick Renaud]
 - revert vref change from rev 6979.
 - added capability for all values to be nodes.

Starship 1 - fixed motor sounds. [Derrick Renaud]

Shuffleboard - started discrete sounds. [Derrick Renaud]

Fixed DMA write mask register in 8237dma. [Mariusz Wojcieszek]

Blue Shark - added octopus sound. [Derrick Renaud]

Corrected rom names for Frogger (Sega set 2) [Derrick Renaud]

Adds PCB layout for Igrosoft's Gambling hardware in the multfish.c 
driver. [Brian Troha]

Removed some old and duplicate code for genesis/megadrive from MAME.
Also, moved some megaplay/megatech constant to a struct and 
refactored some code (work in progress). Updated bootlegs to use 
latest genesis code and finally removed src/mame/drivers/genesis.c!
[Fabio Priuli]

Asserted copyright ownership of core library and OSD files, and 
relicensed them under the standard BSD license, with permission of the
original authors. The files in question all live under src/lib/util 
and src/osd. [Aaron Giles]

Device memory spaces are now visible in the debugger. [Aaron Giles]

Better task processing for discrete sounds: [couriersud]
 - tasks are now processed according to their dependency lists. Tasks
    can now start early and will only process samples which are 
    already available. This has most impact on drivers which have
    significant variance in the run-time of individual tasks.
 - tasks now process samples in slices, currently max 240 samples / 
    slice. 
 - TASK_GROUP is now obsolete - Will update drivers at a later stage.
 - step function pointer now back in node, modules may register 
    optimized step functions.
 - profiling code now always compiled, introduced static int 
    profiling = ... 
 - some more EXPECTED/UNEXPECTED usage.

Fixed Dip Switches for 'attckufo'. [stephh]

Improvements to Noraut poker driver... [Roberto Fresca]
 * Added Draw Poker Hi-Lo hardware support, based on 8080A CPU.
 * Mirrored the PPI's offsets to simplify/merge the hardware emulation.
 * Added hardware documentation and PCB layouts from both DPHL sets.
 * Added DPHL discrete sound circuitry scheme/documentation.
 * Added Turbo Poker 2 from Micro Manufacturing.
 * Added PMA poker.
 * Documented the Turbo Poker 2 hardware.
 * Added Turbo Poker 2 PCB layout from hi-res picture.
 * Switched to the new PPI core.
 * Commented out the 3rd PPI device till handshaked strobe lines can 
    be properly emulated. For now, all VRAM access is through direct 
    handlers. This allow to remove the hacks per set needed to boot 
    the games.
