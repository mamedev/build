MAMETesters Bugs Fixed
----------------------
- 04096: [DIP/Input] sjryuko: Most inputs do not work (Angelo Salese)
- 02561: [Interface] Ability to choose a different name for the UI 
         font (Aaron Giles)



Source Changes
--------------
Create new class osd_interface to house OSD callbacks. Added new
module osdepend.c with default empty implementations. Changed
mame_execute() and cli_execute() to accept a reference to an
osd_interface which is provided by the caller. [Aaron Giles]

Updated SDL and Windows OSD to create an osd_interface-derived class
and moved their OSD callbacks to be members. [Aaron Giles]

Make osdmini build again. [Aaron Giles]

Discrete Sound - Added DISCRETE_XTIME_xxx logic modules.  These allow
you to do logic operations on nodes that use x_time anti-alias info. 
Added the ability to decode x_time to the DISCRETE_BIT_DECODE module. 
This means you can have an oscillator pass x_time onto a counter, get
the counter bits decoded, pass that through the new logic modules and
also have them convert the x_time to energy/anti-alaised voltage. 
Updated Donkey Kong Jr. to use these new modules. [Derrick Renaud]

Convert rendfont to C++. [Aaron Giles]

[SDL Debugger] Removed an unnecessary assert and brought focus back to
the main debugger window on startup. [Andrew Gardner]

Added support for OSD-generated fonts. The OSD is queried first to see
if it owns a given font (based on the name), and if it does, it is
responsible for generating bitmaps on the fly as characters are
requested. [Aaron Giles]

Added new option -uifont to specify the UI font. It can be set to a
filename, in which case a BDF font will be loaded. It can also be set
to a font name (assuming the OSD support is present), in which case
the OSD font by that name is used. The default value is 'default'
which can be used by the OSD to substitute a default font or by the
OSD, which will default to ui.bdf as before. In all cases, it falls
back to the built-in font by default if none of the previous options
works. [Aaron Giles]

  NOTE: On Windows, the OSD will default to Tahoma as the font name. 
  Also on Windows, font names can be specified with [b] to indicate 
  bold or [i] to indicate italic.

Use "default" font for artwork elements as well. Make UI backgrounds a
bit more opaque. Fix crash when passing NULL filename to OSD code.
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed and verified with Test Mode the few System 18 bootlegs located
in the system16.c driver for Inputs and Dip Switches. [Tafoid]

 * Removed old DISCRETE_74LS624 code and replaced it with new 74LS629

i80186/i80286: Fixed bound instruction restart when prefixed with a
segment.  [Wilbert Pol]
