Source Changes
--------------
- Started adding support for scrolling reel displays, currently text
  only, but should be pretty easy to get graphics in there and add
  different direction scrolling - updating sc4 code to use these new
  types.  [David Haywood]

- Stepper display output fix  [James Wallace]

- Amatic Multi Game System driver improvements [Roberto Fresca]
	* Identified the slots game as Super Stars.
	* Changed am_uslot to suprstar.
	* Reworked inputs from the scratch.
	* Added support for outputs: lamps & counters.
	* Added a button-lamps layout.
	* Promoted the game to working state.
	* Added technical notes.

- Amatic AMA-8000 improvements [Roberto Fresca]
	* Renamed amaticmg3 to amaticmg2 since is the AMA-8000-2 system.

	'Q'. Now is possible to payout manually, avoiding the hang for
	hopper empty or timeout.

  value until reset). [Sean Riddle]
