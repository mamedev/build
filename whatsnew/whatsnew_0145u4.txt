Source Changes
--------------
Converted LR35902 cpu core to c++.  [Wilbert Pol]

Fixed swapped romsets between doncdoon and kurufev [Angelo Salese]

SDL: support unofficial (not in the OSD class) num_processors API used
by chdman.  Allows chdman to use multiple cores/processors on
non-Windows. [R. Belmont]

naomi: corrected PIC number information for starseek [Guru]

CPS-1 update [Team CPS-1]:
 * Added some notes and done some documentation fixes.
 * Expanded and updated games table in video\cps1.c
 * Removed the notes about LW-13.10D ROM in forgottnu and RT_23.13B
    ROM in wonder3, since current dumps are confirmed as good.
 * Fixed qad labels and confirmed pcb infos.
 * Fixed ROMs labels, added pcb locations and a better documentation
   about sub-revisions. Renamed some romsets to use revision codes.

Fix for potential driver conflicts with same named machine states
between MAME and MESS.  [David Haywood]

megatech.c: Implemented outputs for the time limit alarm sound and
screen flash. [bdam]

undrfire.c: Implement outputs for undrfire and cbombers.  Lamps, gun
recoil, and wheel vibration are implemented. [bdam]

Fixed colors in senjyo.c driver (mostly noticeable with senjyo
background colors) [Tsuyoshi Hasegawa]

68k: add 68301/68307 aliases for better documentation [David Haywood]

ins8250 - Support for the 16550 fifo [Carl]

viper: Added main board DS2430 eeprom and code1d dongle eeprom. [Guru]

viper: Fixed some IDE parameters to allow HDD games to boot again.
[Ville Linde]

Various improvements to Popo Bear, game is somehow playable with
various video and sound glitches [Angelo Salese]

namcos23: Enable work queues for a substantial framerate boost in 3D
scenes [O. Galibert]

Added redumped Area 51: Site 4 CHD (a51site4a).  [ninjakid]

bfm_sc1.c:  [James Wallace]
 * First pass of splitting out *all* of Scorpion 1 roms into clones so
    that proper testing can begin.
 * Identified some duplicates and 'premerged' versions of split ROM
    files.  So while there are more 'games', the number of ROMs has
    actually decreased.

m6502.c: Fixed OAL illegal m6502 instruction to pass Acid5200 test. 
[Wilbert Pol]

Formalized the Votrax SC-01 device. Implemented the full set of
digital logic from the patent, including the timing circuit,
transition circuit, glottal generator, and noise source. Some unknowns
still exist with regards to clocking, due to contradictory statements
in the patent, but as it stands now, all parameters are fetched and
processed, phonemes are requested, and in theory all that remains is
for someone with analog sound experience to simulate the filters on
the output. For now, you just get the raw glottal pulse mixed with the
noise signal based on the vocal and fricative amplitudes, which is
enough to show progress, but hardly a pleasing result just yet.
[Aaron Giles, Lord Nightmare, Olivier Galibert]

Converted gottlieb r1 and r2 sound boards into full-on devices, using
the recently-added mixer interface. All sound outputs are redirected
to the new sound device itself, and then the consuming driver can
route the new sound device's outputs as appropriate. The Votrax chip
has been hooked up properly, with a crude guess at the variable
clocking. Current Votrax emulation is turned off, but it can be
enabled by changing USE_FAKE_VOTRAX to 0 in gottlieb.h. [Aaron Giles]

Added Driver display in both the game select UI as well as the
gameinfo screens which should prove helpful.  [Tafoid]

chdman: Correct processing of GDI files, add ability to extractcd to
.gdi, verified perfect checksum round-tripping on .GDI files.
[R. Belmont]

Rework libflac to play nicer with MAME's build system; should fix
compile problems on certain configrations based on suggestions by 
Tsuruchiyo Nitro [R. Belmont]

k054539: Modernize [O. Galibert]

PowerPC: properly mirror SO bit from XER into CR0 [R. Belmont]

ioport: Make the compile time less insane [O. Galibert]

ioport: Support obsolete gcc versions [O. Galibert]

When copying CHDs, preserve the flag that indicates whether the
metadata is included in the SHA1. When creating LD CHDs, don't use a
checksum on the AVLD metadata, like we did before. Fixes recompression
of laserdisc CHDs. [Aaron Giles]

Refactored YM3526 to use devcb. [Curt Coder]

Create new devices buffered_spriteram<n>_device, which manage buffered
spriteram. Removed core support for legacy buffered spriteram, and
updated all drivers to use the new devices instead. [Aaron Giles]

Removed required/optional_shared_size helpers. Instead the existing
required/optional_shared_ptr helpers now have a bytes() method that
can be used to query the size of the shared region. [Aaron Giles]

ymf271: Timer setup fix [trap15]

votrax: Analog path [O. Galibert]

tms57002: Modernize [O. Galibert]

Various i386, x87 and PIC fixes. [Carl]

neodrvr.c: Add program roms to Metal Slug 5 PCB. [Guru]

Neo-Geo documentation update [Johnboy]:
 * Added SNK development boards
 * Updated MVS motherboard list
 * Updated sengoku2, zupapa, mslug, neodrift, ctomaday, pbobbl2n and
    jockeygp chip info
 * Added correct product ID codes for vliner and jockeygp
 * Updated \hash\neogeo.xml accordingly

Fix for aleck64 crash on exit [Oliver Stoneberg]

dec8.c improvements [stephh] :
 * lastmisn*, shackled, breywood, gondo, makyosen, garyoret, ghostb*,
    meikyuh*, csilver*, oscar*, srdarwin*, cobracom* : fixed Dip
    Switches and Inputs (after verification of the M6809/HD6309 code);
    coinage for games without real MCU is still a guess though
 * lastmisn*, csilver*, srdarwin* : added coinage simulation based on
    the Dip Switches
 * garyoret : use fake MCU based on 'gondo' instead of simulating it
