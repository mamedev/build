MAMETesters Bugs Fixed
----------------------
- 03969: [Crash/Freeze] All sets and drivers using OKI audio: 
         Eventual crash using Save States (Aaron Giles)
- 03981: [Crash/Freeze] bosco, xevious and clones: Game reboots or 
         hangs (Alex Jackson)
- 03977: [Graphics] tceptor2: Graphics are incorrect, the top and 
         bottom roads are displayed with grids and it looks like 
         there should be 4 instead of 2. (Phil Bennett)

Source Changes
--------------
raiden2.c: Add missing "VOICE2" sample rom to Raiden 2 sets where it
was missing.  Corrected rom names for MASK roms soldered to the PCB.
[Brian Troha]

Southern Systems Joker Poker: Added missing CPU IO map to the machine
driver. This allow boot the game and enter into the attract mode.
[Roberto Fresca]

Mini Boy 7 improvements: [Roberto Fresca]
 * Added a new complete set. Now set as parent.
 * Corrected Xtal frequency.
 * Mapped the PIA MC6821 (not wired since is not totally understood).
 * Preliminary attempt to decode the color PROM.
 * Mapped the AY-3-8910, but still needs ports and some checks.
 * Added debug and technical notes.

New driver for Mega Double Poker, from Blitz System Inc.
[Roberto Fresca]
 * Initial release.
 * Preliminary memory map.
 * Hooked both PIAs, but need more analysis to confirm the offsets.
 * Accurate graphics and color decode.
 * Added main PCB and daughterboard layouts.
 * Added partial docs and diagrams about the CPU/MCU/ROMs addressing.
 * Added debug and technical notes.

Added Magic Train, from Subsino. Since it's driven by a HD647180X0CP6
(Subsino - SS9600) plus SS9601 and SS9602 (for video and I/O
respectively), it's possible that needs to be moved to a new driver in
a near future. Also added technical notes. [Roberto Fresca]

mpu4drvr.c: Fixed mid-screen palette updates [David Haywood]

segas16b.c: Documented the Sega game ID for the Heavyweight Champ rom
board as well as corrected the rom names. [Brian Troha]

Return to type safety. Changed address maps back into functions that
build up the definition, rather than the whole tokenizing system,
which lost type checking. Added a new module addrmap.c which
implements the address map classes, and changed the macros to call
methods on the address_map and address_map_entry classes which are
strongly typed. Fixed a few incorrectly specified memory map entries 
along the way in twincobr.c, lordgun.c, galaxold.c. [Aaron Giles]

More API cleanup: [Aaron Giles]
 * removed cputag_clocks_to_attotime() and cputag_attotime_to_clocks()
    in favor of just expanding the class
 * same for cputag_suspend() and cputag_resume()

Fix crash when exiting the debugger if breakpoints are set. 
[Aaron Giles]

The dsp561xx CPU core now generates accurate disassembly for Konami
Polygonet hardware (verified against Motorola's reference
disassembler). [Andrew Gardner, Stiletto]

Fixed image device error handling [ShimaPong, Miodrag Milanovic]

Defined new class driver_data_t, which all driver_data classes must
derive from. Updated all class definitions to inherit from the new
class, and to call it in the constructor. Also changed the alloc()
signature to return a driver_data_t pointer instead of a void *.
Renamed and hid machine->driver_data as machine->m_driver_data. Added
a new templatized method machine->driver_data<class> which returns a
properly downcast'ed version of the driver data. Updated all code
which looked like this:

  mydriver_state *state = (mydriver_state *)machine->driver_data;

to this:

  mydriver_state *state = machine->driver_data<mydriver_state>();

The new function does a downcast<> which in debug builds dynamically
verifies that you're actually casting to the right type. [Aaron Giles]

Changed atarigen_state to be a base class from which all the related
Atari drivers derive their state from. [Aaron Giles]

Removed global variables from gaelco, namco, and nile sound cores.
[Atari Ace]

Converted seta.c, seta2.c, and ssv.c to driver_data. [Atari Ace]

Updated SAA5050 to form 12x20 chars as noted in documentation.
Updated malzak driver to support SAA5050 changes. [Miodrag Milanovic]

taitotz: add HDD image for Battle Gear 2 (2.04J) [gtbb08, R. Belmont]

namcoic.c: Fixed incorrect road colours in tceptor2, finallap and
others [Phil Bennett]

Fixed road transparency in Thunder Ceptor [Phil Bennett]

Fixed Z80 SIO interrupts by clearing them at constructor time so Z80 
daisy chain works properly and doesn't stall on a non-existant IEO 
condition. [Curt Coder]

Z80 DMA changes: [Curt Coder]
 - Fixed DMA by re-adding a status update call to ENABLE DMA command
 - Allowed illegal mode 0 DMA operation since trs80m2 in MESS is 
    abusing this
 - Fixed ready signal handling by adding a check for ready condition 
    on each byte

Started converting the Toaplan2 VDP into a device [David Haywood]

dsp56k : Hooked up new execution engine. [Andrew Gardner]

plygonet.c : Updates Polygonet driver to use driver_data class.
[Atari Ace]

More refactoring to the Toaplan 2 / GP9001 VDP device [David Haywood]

CPS-1 update [Team CPS-1]:
 * Expanded and updated games table in video\cps1.c
 * Confirmed B-Board # for 3wondersu, varth
 * Fixed labels in ghouls, ghoulsu to match real pcbs
 * Removed 14.bin in dynwarj, it was a bad dump
 * Marked nm_23.12b in nemoj BAD_DUMP
 * Removed knightsja set (roms were split & hacked to work on a
    suicided board)
 * Added roms relationship between parent/clones where missing
 * Fixed some incorrect notes added in previous update
 * dynwaru -> dynwara forgottnua -> forgottnu, forgottnu -> forgottnua
    wofhfb -> wofhfh as real name Huo Feng Huang
 * Reordered some sets
 * Minor cleanups

 * Fixed sf2ceub labels and added pcb infos, removed 1 incorrect rom
    and replaced with proper redump done by Dumping Union

dsp56k.c : Remove globals from dsp56k cpu core. [AtariAce]

cps1.c: Documentation update for some CPS1 sets (B-Board chip
information) verified via Team Japump PCB photos. [Brian Troha]

Improved memory banking in Puzzle Star (Sang Ho Soft)
[Mariusz Wojcieszek]

Fixed term2 (rev. LA4) freeze during the Cyberdyne stage opening
cinematic [Phil Bennett]

Merged aladbl.c and ssf2md.c to create genesisb.c [Sonikos]

video/astrocde.c: Limited the number of timers potentially produced by
astrocade_trigger_lightpen() [ranger_lennier]

cps1.c: Set correct B-Board mapper for "resale" kits.  This fixes
missing graphics in Area 88 (Japan Resale). [Brian Troha]
