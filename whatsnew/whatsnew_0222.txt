3190: Nuon softlist [incog]

6543: seattle.cpp and vegas.cpp: Clean House (nw) [Hydreigon223]
All unnecessary inputs are removed from all respective games without problems. I decided to remove "IMPERFECT_SOUND" from the NBA
  Showtime games because those games used a standard Vegas SIO board.

6592: Consolidated code for pasing enum strings in src/frontend/mame/luaengine.cpp [npwoods]

6596: Move sprite delaying behavior into screen_vblank for some drivers [cam900]
gaiden.cpp, tecmo16.cpp, suprnova.cpp: Move delayed sprite drawing function into screen_vblank
suprnova.cpp: Use generic gfx layout, Fix CPU clock related to XTAL, Use device for screen

6597: tms9914: added SR & PP FSMs, typo fixed [fulivi]
Hi,
I've just added two missing FSMs in TMS9914 emulation (serial request & parallel poll). I've also fixed a typo reported by shattered
  (two bits swapped in a register).
Thanks.
--F.Ulivi

6598: Namco custom fix [hackbar]
Fixes the bootlegs.

6599: Heavily improved emulation of GRiD Compass 1101 [usernameak]
Changes:
- added known dump checksums of 1101 BIOS
- high-level emulation of GPIB disk devices
- partial implementation of DMA (currently ignores ACCRQ so devices must have zero latency in order for it to work)
- serial is now properly memory-mapped
- modem stub in order to make system properly ignore modem device
- it now boots without any patches and debug scripts
- merged #6597 (needed in order to make disk devices work)
Still not implemented:
- RTC/MACHINE_ID
- modem
- has problems with multiple disk devices working simultaneously (possibly BIOS bug because this BIOS had some problems with that on
  real device)

6600: compis.xml: Five new dumps [FakeShemp]
Dumped by myself

6601: sgi_mips: add software list [davide125]
Add an initial software list for SGI MIPS-based systems and hook it up to the Indy and 4D drivers.

6602: hp86: fixed a bug in key auto-repeat function [fulivi]
I've just fixed a bug in HP86 emulation that prevented correct key auto-repeat with non-English keyboard layouts.
Thanks.

6603: Added GAL20V8 support to the jedutil tool [keshbach]
New pull request where ncurses has been removed from jedutil.

6604: nscsi/cd: handle eject command for SGI drives [davide125]
On `indy_4610` running IRIX 5.3, the `eject` command (or selecting the same operation in the UI, e.g. in the cdrom icon context
  menu) causes an immediate abort due to
```
[:scsibus:6:cdrom] Unhandled command ? (1): c4
```
Adding a stub handler for the command allows the system to work properly. Moreover, it is now possible to switch CD media on a
  running system without having to resort to messy workarounds: just switch the media MAME's file manager and run `eject` to make
  IRIX reload it.

6605: tms9914: simplify handling of CIDS state [fulivi]
This PR is for a minor change to tms9914 driver. I simplified a bug fix by @usernameak.

6611: sgi_mips: new software list additions [davide125]

6612: i960dasm fixes and additions [SailorSat]
Based on issue https://github.com/mamedev/mame/issues/6559
- Added 10 opcodes that are currently emulated but missing from the disassembler.
- Operand order was changed to match the _i960® Processor Assembler User's Guide_ as well as _IDA pro_ and _onlinedisassembler.com_
Some things I noticed but did not touch:
- certain opcodes should have 2 operands instead of 3: `not`, `cvtir`, `cvtirl`
the current opcode table does not allow that, though.
- load and store operations with a 1-byte alignment are output differently.
oda.com gives `r10,(g11)[g12]` while MAME gives `st      r10,(g11)[g12*1]`
- branch-on-bit opcodes may be faulty in certain edge cases.
for opcode `30290120` oda.com gives `bbc     r5,r4,...` while MAME gives `bbc     5,r4,...` - the difference being register r5
  instead of constant 5.

6619: indy_indigo2: fix include ordering [davide125]
Move `softlist.h` include before `logmacro.h` per @cuavas comment on https://github.com/mamedev/mame/pull/6601

6620: Fix CoCo cartridge loading for less than 16k carts. [tlindner]
The previous code would get into an infinite loop if the user tried to load a ROM cartridge smaller than or equal to 16k. That's
  because m_cart->get_cart_size() is 16384:
len = min(16384, 16384-16384)
len = 0

6621: Changed default for Becker Port to be off [tlindner]
The becker port is a communication facility originally developed for the CoCo3FPGA project. The I/O is right in the middle of
  cartridge space (the FPGA doesn't have a cartridge port). And in MAME it conflicts with emulated devices attached to the cartridge
  port. I think the better option is to default off.

6622: Add missing discs to IRIX 6.5 [ClawGrip, Rampa] [clawgrip]
* Merged CDs that came on the same bundle and add features with metadata on all entries (nw)
* Replaced some images with cleaner ones (Plextor, without C2 errors) (nw)

6634: Remove colon as a path seperator in the core [tlindner]
I don't believe MAME compiles on any platform where the colon is a path seperator.
So removing this solves a problem when viewing file names in the UI File Manager.

6636: replace Vsmile Motion BIOS [DavidHaywood]
replace vsmile motion BIOS with one from an actual vsmile motion rather than an incorrecctly byteswapped version of the regular

6637: i960dasm: rewrote disassembler [SailorSat]
Based on documents:
- 270567-001  80960KB Programmer's Reference Manual (March 1988)
- 270710-003  i960 CA/CF Microprocessor User's Manual (March 1994)
- 271081-001  80960MC Programmer's Reference Manual (July 1988)
- 272483-001  i960 Jx Microprocessor User's Manual (September 1994)
- 272484-002  i960 Hx Microprocessor Developer's Manual (September 1998)
- 272736-002  i960 Rx I/O Microprocessor Developer's Manual (April 1997)
- 273353-001  Intel 80303 I/O Processor Developer's Manual (May 2000)
Why oh why are there so many different variant of the i960? :)
The older variants (Mx, Kx, Jx) have several bits defined as zeros, which are used for various things in the newer variants (Cx, Hx,
  Rx).
I implemented some checks for all bits that are (still) defined as zeros in newer variants to filter out invalid opcodes.
The disassembler is ignoring the "branch prediction"-flag `T` for now (Cx, Hx, Rx variant).
Later on we should attach `.t`/`.f` to the mnemonics for variants that have branch-prediction.
There is conflicting information on the `COBR M1` flag:
- Mx, Kx, Jx, Rx references declare `M1 set` means "literal"
- Hx reference declares `M1 set` means "special function"-register

6642: Fix typos in PORT_CHAR definitions [palazzol]

6643: Drivers (4) for Grant Searle's Simple machines (Z80, CP/M, 6502, and 6809) [palazzol]
See http://searle.wales/ for details.  Drivers are gsz80, gscpm, gs6502, and gs6809.

6645: Update hd6309.ops [tlindner]
$1020 is an illegal opcode on the 6309. On the 6809 it is a rarely used form of LBRA. I tested on a real 6309 and $1020 vectors to
  Illegal.

6646: add init to convert twinbeeb bubble dump into something the driver can actually use (nw) [DavidHaywood]
this is proof of the problem.. better would be to know why the dump was stripped in the first place...

6647: raiden2.cpp: add U0342 PAL to ROM definitions [neSneSgB]
jj4b02__ami18cv8-15.u0342.zip
https://twitter.com/neSneSgB/status/1232115385303879680 Discussion starting here, I successfully dumped the missing U0342 from a
  location test US Raiden 2, and confirmed that the dump worked on a final Raiden 2 PCB. I converted it to a binary using jedutil to
  generate the CRC and SHA1.

6648: Fix for UI Paste with the Default Serial Terminal [palazzol]
Without this fix, 8 characters @^&()\:" cannot be pasted from the UI into serial terminal.

6650: Add partial support for all IAC messages [RyogaMasaki]
Currently, one IAC message is supported (0x93) by the i960KB cpu emu, but the manual defines several more. Any unsupported messages
  call fatalerror and kill MAME. It seems that this hasn't been an issue for most games, but it does cause VF2, Fighting Vipers and
  Sonic the Fighters to crash when using the debug menu, as outlined here:
  http://sudden-desu.net/entry/debug-tools-in-virtua-fighter-2-fighting-vipers-and-sonic-the-fighters
This patch adds cases for each of the IAC messages outlined in the 80960KB Programmer's Reference Manual (chapter 13). While there
  isn't much actual code implementation, this will at least prevent MAME from fatal'ing.

6651: 6309: removed wrong BRA [tlindner]
nw: I removed the wrong BRA in the last patch. This one puts the correct BRA back on and removes the BRA that is illegal.

6660: Debugger - add `-debuglog` option to log debug console output to file [Stevie-O]
When this option is specified, all console output is echoed to a log
file.
Some caveats/limitations:
- The file-open process was copied from -log, so it has the same limits
  - Filename is hard-coded (debug.log)
  - File is overwritten if it exists
  - File is opened during emulation initialization
    - Thus, the file is cleared if you invoke the "Hard Reset"
      debugger command
  - Probably some other details I don't know about
- Logging works as such: When a string is appended to the scrollback
  buffer, it is also written to the log file.
  Some commands forcibly wrap their output (e.g. `help` to 80 columns.)
  Because this wrapping is done inside the scrollback buffer, the text
  written to the file is not wrapped.
  This can be seen with `help execution`.

6661: fix HFE disk write [kkaempf]
this fixes https://mametesters.org/view.php?id=7526
`src/lib/formats/hxchfe_dsk.cpp` reproducibly creates a SEGV when writing HFE files. This is caused by an endless loop in
  `hfe_format::generate_hfe_bitstream_from_track`, writing beyond end-of-array at
  https://github.com/mamedev/mame/blob/140ba5147df230751a87a62374eba8880f5d3dbe/src/lib/formats/hxchfe_dsk.cpp#L683
The endless loop is caused by re-setting `cur_pos` at two occasions and re-setting the loop variable.
This fix drops the reset of `cur_pos` resulting in a successful write of a mixed-density (track0 sd, others dd) HFE image.

6699: identified 3 bad bits in csilver MCU dump, corrected them, hooked up MCU, removed simulation [dink] [DavidHaywood]
(note, this causes loss of coinage sound, it doesn't generate the same interrupt on the MCU as the other games at least as there's
  no code for that)

6700: sgi_mips: new software list additions [davide125]
Also update publisher for some entries.

6711: First completed pass of commandline parameters. (nw) [Firehawke]
**PLEASE READ:**
Here's a first pass at commandline parameter examples.
I'm not expecting this to be to everyone's satisfaction, so it's probably best to let this sit until everyone has had a chance to go
  through it. I'll fix what issues you find at that point.
In particular, the GLSL stuff is expected to need more work.
This also includes a first pass at VRR information in the FAQ. I plan to revisit this after the main commandline stuff is worked out
  as I've found some useful information on Blur Busters in regards to VRR's quirks.

6721: mc6850: TDRE should read clear in reset, and set coming out of reset [68bit]
Fixes a lockup running UniFlex on the SWTPC09.
Tested on hardware, the TDRE flag reads as zero in the reset state and
reads as set when taken out of reset, and even if data has been written
to the data register while in the reset state.

6725: some small GPL16250 tweaks / hacks so that tkmag220 and lazertag show more (nw) [DavidHaywood]
tkmag220 will fairly quickly show a rom test screen where the check fails (not surprising, ROM is banked etc. and might need some
  swapping applied) (nw)
lazertag, after a long time unthrottled, will show a single screen of sprites, there are palettes uploaded for something else before
  that, but like many of these it never seems to populate tile ram (nw)

6755: bloodbro_ms.cpp: Add missing PROMs to 'bloodbrom' [jordigahan, ClawGrip] [clawgrip]

6756: asmjit: new 3rdparty library [pmackinlay]
I propose adding this library to MAME.
The intent is to use it to replace the x86 and amd64 code emitter logic in the current and potential future MAME drc backend(s). The
  author of the library has plans (although no timeframe) to support ARM targets in the future, which would likely also be useful
  for a backend targeting those architectures.
In my opinion, it ticks the boxes in terms of zlib license, mostly tidy C++11 code, no external dependencies, active development,
  good feature set, Windows/OSX/Linux and MSVC/Clang/GCC support, and a seemingly sensible API.
I have made one change to the source code, uncommenting the definition of the ASMJIT_STATIC preprocessor variable in the
  api-config.h header; defining it in the build script appeared to be a better option, but caused linker warnings that I couldn't
  see how to resolve without polluting the rest of the build with the definition.
I have tested compiling and running a driver which uses the library under MSVC and GCC without observing any problems.

6758: BIOS versions, drivers and documentation in at, pc, genpc and europc.cpp [rfka01]

6759: k037122.cpp: Update hardware information [cam900]
hornet.cpp: Add screen raw parameters (verified in both voodoo and K037122 display timing parameters), Add notes

6760: mw8080bw: 280zzzap netlist audio [colinhowell]
This sounds and performs OK on reasonably modern hardware. It has more overhead than the Gun Fight netlist, but that's because the
  sound circuits are much more complex. Performance on my 2014 MacBook Pro (2.5 GHz Core i7) is around 2 x when unthrottled.
The sound seems to have more treble and less bass than what I hear in the few videos of real 280-ZZZAP machines I can find, and the
  "skid" sound is less distinct than on those machines. This may be due to the effect of the arcade cabinet, the audio power
  amplification, or perhaps different component values between the schematic I used and real PCBs. Verification against the latter
  would be a good idea.
This netlist, with some modifications for differences in components and circuits, should also be able to support Laguna Racer and
  Super Speed Race.

6781: Debugger: add `condump` command to export console buffer to a log file [Stevie-O]
This is another debugger enhancement -- it allows you to export the
current contents of the debug console window to a file.
The filename parsing is based on the `trace` command, and as such,
supports both the "{game}" placeholder, and the ">>" prefix for
appending instead of overwriting.

6782: pc.cpp: more consistent ROM naming, versions 0.7e to 0.9 of the ROMs you find on the project page don't have versioned
  filenames. [rfka01]

6784: Correct Game Name Machine fredmem and clones [phweda]

6792: taitowlf: update documentation (nw) [Hydreigon223]
Some of these components were already mentioned later in the driver. "TODO" wasn't really correct because main board (and rom board
  connected to main board) all communicate with the PC motherboard via PCI. Figuring out PCI comms between both boards as well as
  reading the two program roms, u1 and u2, may prove tricky.

6795: Change aspect ratio for Konami Twinkle to 16:9 [tertu-m]
All games running on the Twinkle hardware shipped with anamorphic 16:9 widescreen monitors. In 4:3, most graphics appear squashed
  horizontally. (beatmania IIDX continued to use anamorphic widescreen after switching to PC hardware with 9th style.)
This also updates the Lamps layout to display the screen in 16:9 and changes the color of the 16-segment display to "LED red" to
  match the 16-segment displays that were used on the machines.

- Reordered some disks so they are auto-mounted in a more logical way
- Some minor title / spelling fixes

6814: some spg2xx bits [DavidHaywood]
- looked at Speed Racer I2CMEM, it saves (you can do a race of the global championship, and see the scores from the race table
  stored in there once you select save) but loading fails.  Type is identified, maybe something unique about it? (nw)
- looked at Ford Racing steering / pedal inputs, seems to be an issue with the sp2xx emulation, the adc ports are only read in test
  mode, once you go in game there's no adc interrupt an no gas etc. inputs. (nw)

6816: megadriv.xml: Added info on some games which require proper dumping [ICEknigh7]
Just a couple of observations in the Earthworm Jim (USA) and Streets of Rage 3 (USA) entries, based on no-intro's site and my own

**Setting value** is _table key_, **setting name** is _table value_, which may look like they're reversed, but it's not a mistake:
  we're sending digital values, they're the primary subject here, and setting names are just hints for humans.

6823: ibm5170.xml: add 4 new dumps [rzero9]

fixed gfx rom loading and decode (sf2rk_init), fixes corrupt sprite issues (text, zangief etc.)
added note and rom patch regarding the dark screen issue, confirmed present on real pcb.
patch disabled by default as correct behaviour is to have no palette fade effects and turn up contrast as with real pcb/monitor,

-Heavily improved emulation of GRiD Compass 1101 (#6599) [usernameak]
 * Changes:
   - added known dump checksums of 1101 BIOS
   - high-level emulation of GPIB disk devices
   - partial implementation of DMA (currently ignores ACCRQ so devices must have zero latency in order for it to work)
   - serial is now properly memory-mapped
   - modem stub in order to make system properly ignore modem device
   - it now boots without any patches and debug scripts
   - merged #6597 (needed in order to make disk devices work)
   - Still not implemented:
   - RTC/MACHINE_ID
   - modem
   - has problems with multiple disk devices working simultaneously (possibly BIOS bug because this BIOS had some problems with that
      on real device)

-netlist: Fix a long standing bug in proxy/family code. (nw) [couriersud]
 * This never materialized because proxies were always connected to GND in existing netlists. Now I ran into an example were it
    kicked in.

-netlist: Add simple ZDIODE model. [Couriersud]
 * The model is driven by three additional model parameters: NBV, IBV, BV.
   - Example code how to define a typical 7.5V Zener diode:
     * ZDIODE(ZD, "D(BV=7.5 IBV=0.01 NBV=3)")
       - or
         * NET_MODEL("A1234 D(BV=7.5 IBV=0.01 NBV=3)") ZDIODE(ZD, "A1234")

-naomigd: Eliminate get_read_ptr (nw) [AJR]

-t11: More accurate emulation of interrupt acknowledgment; add PF and HLT interrupts [AJR]
 * (nw) This is accurate behavior for the T11, but it makes some of the driver changes a bit more awkward than they probably should
    be, given that one device is standing in for every CPU vaguely related to the PDP-11 family. Galaxy Game obviously wasn't
    written for a T11, and the BK-0010's K1801VM1 doesn't look like a lot like the T11 either.

-CoCo: Changed driver coco3dw1 to have a default on becker port. [tim lindner]

-netlist: Adding prandom.h (nw) [couriersud]

-netlist: Fix some tidy warnings. (nw) [couriersud]

 * polepo/megapede: They should run on 16K / move to games section / add '/' to start
 * Signed-off-by: Andreas Müller <schnitzeltony@gmail.com>

-netlist: Add two noise sources. [Couriersud]
 * The two sources act as voltage sources, though noise may also be injected as conductivy or current noise.
   - SYS_NOISE_MT_U: Mersenne Twister uniform noise SYS_NOISE_MT_N: Mersenne Twister normal noise
     * nld_sys_noise is templated:
       - using NETLIB_NAME(sys_noise_mt_u) = NETLIB_NAME(sys_noise)<plib::mt19937_64, plib::uniform_distribution_t>;
         * Thus the approach is scalable. The implementation is state save aware, and thus reproducible results are guaranteed.
           - An example use case is provided as well, see examples/noise.cpp.

-netlist: simplify pfunction state handling. (nw) [couriersud]
 * Removes dependency on pstate.h.

-hh_pic16: rename sfxchas to flash (nw) [hap]

-cischeat.cpp: fix scudhamm/armchmp2 irq and refresh rate to be measured 59.17 Hz instead of 30 [Angelo Salese]

-Fix OS X build (implicit inclusion differences between standard libraries strike again) (nw) [AJR]

-hh*: use full companyname for Ideal (nw) [hap]

-Refocus debugger on CPU when one of its watchpoints is hit. This solution may be less than ideal for some multiprocessing
 environments where CPUs share spaces, but it prevents the focus from shifting unpredictably to whichever CPU happens to be next in
 line to execute (e.g. when synchronization for a soundlatch write aborts the original CPU's timeslice). [AJR]

   - i86: Correct a fortuitously harmless typo in state registration (nw)

-i86, i286: Update m_prev_ip (and therefore CURPC) after taking interrupt (nw) [AJR]

-netlist: Restructered the save state system. (nw) [couriersud]
 * This change makes state saving contract based. Objects which need to save state need to have the following template member:
   - template <typename ST> void save_state(ST &st) { /* Example */ st.save_item(m_p,   "m_p"); st.save_item(m_buf, "m_buf"); }
     * This member function is called when the object is passed to the state manager save function.

-netlist: nlwav - new functionality. [Couriersud]
 * nlwav now supports 16 and 32 bit integer format (wav16s, wav32s) as well as 32 bit float format (wav32f). The "wav" format is no
    longer supported. Added support for high and low pass filtering the wav output. Dynamic volume adjustment (use "-a 0")
   - -hpboost can suppress spikes at the beginning of the file (<10ms)
   - The addition of the float format simplifies debugging significantly since it covers the whole dynamic format.
   - Added nlwav to the local VS 2019 build.

-raiden2.cpp: add U0342 PAL to ROM definitions [neSneSgB]
 * https://twitter.com/neSneSgB/status/1232115385303879680 Discussion starting here, I successfully dumped a .jed from a location
    test US Raiden 2, and confirmed that the dump worked on a final Raiden 2 PCB. The .jed is downloadable from that thread, and I

-Fixed regression in peps0615 introduced in 635f469c7dd0b5166455bafeddb0e898b1081165, the game writes to the page buffer then sends
 a spurious start condition before the stop condition that writes the buffer. [smf]
 * Created i2cmem sub classes for all used device types, fixed the buffer sizes that were wrong, removed the methods for modifying
    the data & buffer sizes and changed the drivers to use the correct types. [smf]
   - Switched aa310 & ertictac over to use device/machine/pcf8583.cpp, which is not currently based on i2cmem.cpp but might be worth

-Debugger - add `-debuglog` option to log debug console output to file [Stephen Oberholtzer]
 * When this option is specified, all console output is echoed to a log file.
   - Some caveats/limitations:
     * The file-open process was copied from -log, so it has the same limits
     * Filename is hard-coded (debug.log)
     * File is overwritten if it exists
     * File is opened during emulation initialization
     * Thus, the file is cleared if you invoke the "Hard Reset" debugger command
     * Probably some other details I don't know about
     * Logging works as such: When a string is appended to the scrollback buffer, it is also written to the log file.
     * Some commands forcibly wrap their output (e.g. `help` to 80 columns.) Because this wrapping is done inside the scrollback
        buffer, the text written to the file is not wrapped.
     * This can be seen with `help execution`.

 * working macro level parameters
 * simplified code significantly

 * dead code removal
 * It is now possible to define netlist level parameters using:
 * static NETLIST_START(chip) DEFPARAM(parameter, 123) RES(R1, $(@.parameter)) .... NETLIST_END()
 * NETLIST_START(main)
 * chip(X1) PARAM(X1.parameter, 1000) ... NETLIST_END()
 * This will pass on 1000 to R1 as a parameter.
 * "@." will resolve to the current namespace. In this case it is X1, thus "X1.parameter. This is during parsing. During evalution,
    i.e. device creation, $(X1.parameter) is evaluated to 1000.
 * This also means, that global parameters are possible and accessible ...
 * DEFPARAM(P, 234) ... RES(R1, $(P))
 * or going forward
 * RES(R1, 1000) CAP(C1, 1.0 / $(R1.R))
 * This opens up the path to more possibilities ...
 * static NETLIST_START(DM9456_DIP) DEFPARAM(MODEL, "74XX") DM9456_GATE(X1) DM9456_GATE(X2) PARAM(X1.MODEL, $(@.MODEL))
    PARAM(X2.MODEL, $(@.MODEL)) ... NETLIST_END()
 * NETLIST_START(main)
 * DM9456_DIP(X1) PARAM(X1.MODEL, "LS74XX") ... NETLIST_END()
 * The code also has been prepared to allow something along the lines of
 * LIBENTRY_MODEL(DM74LS00_DIP, DM7400_DIP, "LS74XX")
 * to define a LS version on top of an DM7400_DIP bare TTL implementation. This however will need more efforts to existing devices
    to honour some timing adjustment in the model definition. It will already honour different output specifications between LS
    series and bare TTL if connected to analog components.

-(nw) basic52: cleaned up, added sound, bypassed baud auto-detect. [Robbbert]

-netlist: rewrite rom devices from scratch. [Couriersud]
 * Thanks to Aaron Giles who made me think about a different approach.
   - This is a rewrite from scratch for rom devices. It uses a generic template to implement rom devices which is used together with
      a description struct to define a rom device. This leads to highly efficient code since all information is available at compile
      time.
     * This is also a step forward to support tristate outputs. All rom devices covered by this approach have tristate or open
        collector outputs and thus all code changes to support tristate outputs can now be made consistently in one file.

 * These tristate buffers natively support tristate outputs. For use cases with fixed enable inputs the devices support a parameter
    FORCE_TRISTATE_LOGIC which if being set to 1 makes the device behave like a logic output.
   - Added additional syntax and consistency checks for tristate outputs. Updated the example and added dip implementations

-emumem: Slight speedup [O. Galibert]

-emumem: Another slight speedup, implemented on the 680x0 for now [O. Galibert]
 * memory_access_specific is declared and used exactly like memory_access_cache, but does not cache.  It does, however, shortcut the
    virtual call into address_space, so that's one layer of call less. Gives another nice speedup for accesses with bad locality
    (e.g. anything that's not opcodes), at the expense of having a specifically typed object in the class.  Should do well for cpus
    in general, drivers can keep using the address_space access calls for easier logistics.

-emumem: A little more speedup.  cache and specific change syntax, and are not pointers anymore [O. Galibert]
 * The last(?) two changes are:
   - Add a template parameter to everything (theoretically the address space width, in practice a level derived from it to keep as
      much compatibility between widths as possible) so that the shift size becomes a constant.
   - Change the syntax of declaring and initializing the caches and specifics so that they're embedded in the owner device.  Solves
      lifetime issues and also removes one indirection (looking up the base dispatch pointer through the cache/specific pointer).

-unsp20 - fix opcode decode priority, we causing an ASR operation to be decoded as a MUL [David Haywood] (#6740) [David Haywood]

-Debugger expression and memory access overhaul [AJR]
 * Memory references in expressions no longer default to the console's visible CPU if no device name was specified, except when
    entered through the console itself. Expressions in view windows now use the context of the currently selected device instead.
 * The pcatmem debug command and similar qt mouseover function now produce an error message if the initial address translation
    fails.
 * Related internal changes (nw)
 * The debugger_cpu class no longer interprets memory accesses. The existing routines have been moved into symbol_table (which used
    to invoke them as callbacks), and reimplemented in most other places. Thecode duplication is a bit messy, but could be
    potentially improved in the future with new utility classes.
 * The cheat engine no longer needs to hook into the debugger_cpu class or instantiate a dummy instance of it.
 * The inclusion of debug/express.h within emu.h has been undone. Some debugging structures now need unique_ptr to wrap the
    resulting incomplete classes; hopefully the performance impact of this is negligible. Another direct consequence is that the
    breakpoint, watchpoint and registerpoint classes are no longer inside device_debug and have their own source file.
 * The breakpoint list is now a std::multimap, using the addresses as keys to hopefully expedite lookup.
 * The visible CPU pointer has been removed from the debugger_cpu class, being now considered a property of the console instead.
 * Many minor bits of code have been simplified.

-mw8080bw: 280zzzap netlist audio (#6760) [Colin Douglas Howell]
 * mw8080bw: update 280zzzap audio API in preparation for netlist audio
 * This is only API changes, following the pattern used by cuavas within the past year to update other games in mw8080bw.
 * mw8080bw: new netlist audio implementation for 280zzzap
 * New netlist-based audio implementation for 280zzzap (280-ZZZAP, 1976), derived from Midway game logic board schematic. The sound
    generally matches that heard in videos of the machine, though the real machine seems to have more bass and less treble. This may
    be a cabinet effect or something else, such as a difference in component values.
 * Due to the number of complex components being emulated and the nature of the circuits, this netlist adds a lot of overhead, but
    it's still fast enough to run at greater than real speed on modern hardware.
 * With minor changes, this implementation should also support lagunar (Laguna Racer, 1977); with somewhat more substantial changes,
    it would also support sspeedr (Super Speed Race, 1979). Both of these games use sound circuits based on those for 280-ZZZAP.

   - This increase is driven by using a global memory pool in the solver code.
     * In addition the following refactoring and code maintenance work is included. Please excuse the large commit, some of this
        took interfered with other work and the detail development steps were ugly.
       - gsl support: This commit adds pgsl.h which implements a very limited number of the functionality of the gsl header
          described in the c++ core guidelines.
       - clang-tidy fixes
       - A significant refactoring of palloc.h. Aligned hints were removed, they added complexity without a significant performance
          gain. Vector operations should better be done on special spans/views.
       - The code has been tested on linux with g++-7, g++-9, clang-11. On Windows mingw-10 and VS2019, OSX clang-11.
