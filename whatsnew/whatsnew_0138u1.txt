Documented an energy bar debug switch in aladbl, disabled by default
[Angelo Salese]

Konami devices: Fixed sprite Z code rejection regression [hap]

Basic hook-ups of the Nintendo Super System BIOS [Angelo Salese]

tempest: Re-added sparkle bit that mysteriously vanished during the
0.108u5 Atari vector hardware rewrite, its randomization is not
accurate though [hap]

and other games that use it [Bryan Ischo]

tecmo.c: Included Rygar PCB documentation [Guru]

Documented and worked around a long standing level 3 protection fault
in Pop Flamer [Angelo Salese]

Rewritten palette initialization in Naughty Boy HW by using the RESNET
[Angelo Salese]

Rewrote Z180 cycle accounting to create a basis for more exact
internal I/O and timer operations as well as implementing interrupt
priorities. Removed unused BIG_SWITCH code as well. [Couriersud]

MPU4 Updates [James Wallace]:
 * Added trackball support
 * Fixed quiz game controls
 * Restructured AWP games' characteriser handling

Added photo y2k2 decryption table [iq132]

Improved Z180 interrupt and timer handling. Added some missing save
state entries and fixed HALT. [Couriersud]

Rewrote rom/ram banking. 20pacgal now supports save state.
[Couriersud]

Added DIP LOCATIONS to Pengo, Jr. Pac-Man and clones.  [Tafoid]

zaccaria.c: Improved sprite drawing, added DIP locations [hap]

Ported Super Famicom Box from MESS to MAME [Angelo Salese] 

Modified the naomi clipping a bit to avoid so many black lines 
at the bottom [David Haywood]

New Super 3D Golf Simulation - Waialae No Kiseki / Super Mahjong 2
(Super Famicom Box) [Angelo Salese]

Removed Groove on Fight boot hack, not anymore needed [Angelo Salese]

Added x/y boundary checking to ST-V bitmaps [Angelo Salese]

atarigx2.c: More rom name corrections as verified against a Moto
Frenzy Mini Deluxe PCB. Added ROM for the "Clarn" game link sub PCB.
[Charles MacDonald, P. Sealy, Smitdogg, The Dumping Union]

Added lfsr-driven starfield to 20pacgal. The general principle is
understood now but star set selection and the star drawing condition
are guesses. [Couriersud]

Moved global and static variables in driver galaga into a machine
class. Renamed some variables, e.g. galaga_videoram and bosco_videoram
to just videoram. [Couriersud]

to be more accurate. [Lord Nightmare, The Dumping Union]

Verified TMS5200 and Vsync clocks from hardware [Corrado Tomaselli]

Added debug_global_input_code_pressed_once() function to input.c
[Angelo Salese]

Added a readyq callback to the TMS5220 interface. This is needed to
solve MT #3832. In zaccaria games, the intq and readyq are connected
to pia 6821 lines ca2 and cb1 which are edge driven. Just reading
readyq would miss to detect a state change if between reads readyq
went 0-1-0. Updated zaccaria.c and looping.c. Fixes MT #3832.
[Couriersud]

Reworked rendering in toaplan2 to render tilemaps / sprites in a
single pass, should be more accurate to hardware. Note, this further
breaks the mixing in Batsugun and Dogyuun because the previous hacks
can no longer work with the new rendering code. These games have been
demoted to NOT_WORKING status until a better solution is found; they
never worked properly anyway due to the extent of the video hacks
needed to support them [David Haywood]

documentation: Cleaned up company names [hap]

Added NSC800 CPU emulation to the Z80 core [Sandro Ronco]

Updated Legendary Wings with actual PCB speed readings.
[Corrado Tomaselli]

page. [Lord Nightmare, David Widel]

Over Rev, they now enters into attract mode [Angelo Salese]
