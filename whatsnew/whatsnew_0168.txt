Huge thanks to PVS-Studio's owners for giving us a temporary license in order to troubleshoot
issues in our code.

Also big thanks goes to JetBrains for giving us licenses for their ReSharper and CLion 
projects that are helping us to improve MAME.

Source Changes
--------------

-zx: Start of a hardware-correct rewrite [O. Galibert]

-Aristocrat MKV driver: More accurate documentation. Also added some
 technical notes. [Roberto Fresca]

-osborne1 improvements [Vas Crabb]
 * Bank low 16k according to schematics, passes memory test
 * Handle memory mapped I/O addresses according to schematics
 * Correct vectoring of IEEE488 interrupt
 * Add serial port emulation
 * Fix beeper frequency/timing
 * Fix scrolling behvaviour in standard and SCREEN-PAC modes
 * Implement RESET key (generates NMI, F12 by default)
 * Show contents of video memory in F4 tilemap viewer
 * Add configured banking and save state support

-Osborne Vixen: fixed screen (thanks to OG who added M1 support to the
 Z80). Various other fixes. Marked as Working [Robbbert]

-n64: Simulation of cpu cycles from the skipped RDRAM initialization.  [Happy]
 This allows later SI initialization to see something closer to an
 expected value for the system uptime.

-making logerror part of machine and device classes [Miodrag Milanovic]
 display tag of device that logged message

-naomi/triforce docs update [f205v]

-peplus.c: Documentation update based on newly found PSR (Program
 Summary Report). [Kevin N, BrianT]

-TMS5xxx: Fix for occasional audio 'spike' instability/wraparound
 glitches caused by improper truncation in the lattice filter
 multiplier. This is not an optimal fix as it isn't correct to
 hardware, but it works better than the previous approximation.
 [Lord Nightmare]

-Derived a new machine with improved memory map, remapped the roms
 load, and created proper inputs set for Genie (ICP-1, set 2). Also
 added technical notes and findings... [Roberto Fresca]

-Goldnpkr.c driver: Added games and technical notes, and some
 clean-ups... [Roberto Fresca]

-Fix all instances of PVS-Studio warning V578, "An odd bitwise operation
 detected. Consider verifying it". [MooglyGuy]

-Sharp MZ series:
 * MZ-700: Increased speed of basic (MT 06058) by using bankdev; [Robbbert]
 * MZ-700: Fixed shift, ctrl, function keys;
 * MZ-800: Fixed crash when ramdisk accessed;
 * MZ1500: now starts up and can run some programs;
 * MZ-800, MZ-80K, MZ-80A can load mzf tapes.

-Fix some instances of PVS-Studio warning V501, "There are identical
 sub-expressions to the left and to the right of an operator". [MooglyGuy]

-hdc92x4: Fix ambiguity of ?: operator flagged by PVS-Studio [MooglyGuy]

-Jack Potten's Poker (NGold, set 3) improvemente: Fixed wrong inputs /
 coin lines through dedicated inputs. Also fixed graphics.
 [Roberto Fresca]

-Serial ports added to imds2 [F. Ulivi]

-Fix PVS-Studio warning V562, "It's odd to compare a bool type value with
 a value of 0/1" [MooglyGuy]

-Fix PVS-Studio warning V564, "The &/| operator is applied to bool
 type value. You've probably forgotten to include parentheses." [MooglyGuy]

-goldnpkr.c driver improvements. [Roberto Fresca]

-cmpacman: fix two DIP switches [Vas Crabb]

-Added partial decryption to the ICP1 daughterboard games. (currently
 only pokerduc set). Since it's just partial, commented out the code
 for now.... [Roberto Fresca]

-Added port impulse to the Golden Poker's second coin slot. This is
 needed for both royale sets. [Roberto Fresca]

-amstad: Transtape WIP support. [Barry Rodewald]

-a7800.c - More accurately reflect '0x02XX' map per hardware
 documentation and testing. [Mike Saarna, Robert Tuccitto]

-TMS5220 and TMS5110: Add more verbosity to DEBUG_LATTICE
 [Lord Nightmare]

-namcos23: Better handle on the GPU comms [O. Galibert]

-OSD/SDL: add missing header to fix build on NetBSD. [Thomas Klausner]
 The file was removed from the other gmake.*/genie.make files. The
 build/gmake.* files do not exist upstream, so this is a purely local
 problem.

-namcos23: port b bit 6 is also an input, handle accordingly.  Probably
 JVS. [O. Galibert]

-mc6845: fixed hd6845 rasters in interlace mode [Nigel Barnes]
 * bbc now uses correct hd6845
 * saa5050 outputs all 20 scanlines

-a6809: Removed hack and fixed display for above saa5050 changes.[Robbbert]

-bbc: softlist additions/changes [Nigel Barnes]
 * added part_id to many items
 * added original protected floppies (FSD)

-bbc: preliminary support for FSD format. [Nigel Barnes]

-naomi.c: added "NAOMI Development BIOS v1.10" [Andy Geezer, MetalliC]

-Aristocrat MKIV driver: Changed the Fever Pitch input scheme and
 artwork layout, since it seems that the game lacks of a gambling or
 double-up feature. Also cleaned a bit the driver. [Roberto Fresca]

-Aristocrat MKIV driver: Fever Pitch service input is just 'reserve'
 feature/function. Changed the inputs and artwork layout accordingly.
 [Roberto Fresca]

-HLSL [ImJezze]
 * removed duplicate prescale fields
 * made visibility of HLSL options depending on screen type
 * disabled scanlines for LCD screen type
   Fixed reset of HLSL settings
 * fixed bug that resets the HLSL settings when the screen size has
    changed
 * removed hardcoded HLSL presets
 * updates HLSL readme
 * fixed creation order of D3D and HLSL resources
 * sliders will be hidden when toggled off and will be shown when
    toggled on again
 * screen adjustment (scale, offset) can now be handled by the
    respective render API itself (default behavior is as before)
 * D3D (if HLSL) is activated handles screen adjustment by itself
    within the shader, which fixes the odd behavior of some effects
    (e.g. round corners) when screen scale and offset is used
 * fixed bug that resets the HLSL settings when switching between
    window mode and fullscreen
 * fixed changed screen adjustment for multi screens
 * the vector renderer now tries to detect a invariabel vector
    intensity and disables the calculation of a dynamic beam width
 * fixed not used HLSL settings from <custom>.ini if MAME was started
    without driver parameter
 * removed default values from HLSL sliders, the defaults here are
    more like null values to hint when an effect would be disable
 * slightly changed default HLSL settings
 * fixed missing shadow mask texture when switching between window
    mode and full screen

-z800x: Fix the disassembly [Oliver Lehmann]

-ap2_dsk.c: support 36-track Apple II NIB images [Peter Ferrie]

-wozfdc: Warp factor 4 Scotty (much less CPU usage now!) [O. Galibert]

-vrender0: allow resolutions higher than 512x240 [Luca Elia]

-Updated OS/2 support for GEnie and MAME [KO Myung-Hun]

-mcatadv.c: Improved Nostradamus emulation [David Haywood]
 * Sprite masking effect supported (stage 6 boss)
 * Tilemap enable supported (flickering shadow for stage 7 boss)
 * Priority 0 sprites now shown (final boss arms)
 * BG colour changed to more likely pen (fade in/out on intro & end)

-se3208: make sure the low bits of the stack pointer are always 0 [Luca Elia]

-se3208.c: disallowed unaligned dword reads/writes, this allows
 Donggul Donggul Haerong to function, although not 100% sure it's the
 correct fix [David Haywood]

-Allow for Emscripten compile to JavaScript out of the box. [Justin Kerk]
 MAME can now be built using Emscripten's 'emmake' tool, e.g. like so:
 emmake make SUBTARGET=pacman SOURCES=src/mame/drivers/pacman.cpp
 This should produce a .js file which can be supplied to an HTML front-end.
