Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] The new Allegro library supports the Gravis GrIP devices, use
  -joy grip or -joy grip4 to enable.


Source:
-------

- [DOS] Now compiled with Allegro 3.9.26 WIP.

- Several improvements to FM sound emulators. This also fixes crashes in some
  Jaleco Mega System 1 games. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- Improvements to the other YM2151 emulator too. [Jarek Burczynski]

- VIDEO_UPDATE_BEFORE_VBLANK is now the default. If you want your driver to
  redraw the screen after vblank, use VIDEO_UPDATE_AFTER_VBLANK.

- Rewritten the HC55516 CVSD decoder. This affects Sinistar, Joust 2, Arch
  Rivals, Pigskin, Tri-Sports, Smash TV, Trog, Narc. [Aaron Giles]

- Some improvements to the Z80 emulator. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Some fixes to HD63701 IRQ handling, and support for ICI (Input Capture
  Interrupt). [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- Improvements to the 34010 emulation. [Aaron Giles]

- New function findmemorychunk() that lets you look up a chunk of memory and
  get its start/end addresses, and its base. This can be used (carefully!) by
  drivers that wish to access memory directly without going through the
  readmem/writemem accessors (e.g., blitters). [Aaron Giles]

- Replaced cpu_reset() with cpu_set_reset_line().
  cpu_set_reset_line(num,PULSE_LINE) is equivalent to the old cpu_reset().
  ASSERT_LINE resets the cpu and halts it. CLEAR_LINE restarts it.
  This avoids the need to call cpu_halt() in most cases. [Nicola Salmoria]
