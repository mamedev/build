Support for saving hi scores (game A and B) for Game & Watch Donkey Kong Jr. using hiscore plugin.
Tested in Batocera Linux v39 (MAME v0.261)
EDIT: this is my first contribution - I read the documentation and could get more input as to the best way to add other Game & Watch
  driver updates to hiscore.dat as I complete & validate them.  Should I just keep adding commits to this branch until it is merged
  (what I’m planning to do as I don’t expect this pull request to be processed immediately) or create separate pull requests?

12378: coco: add Zonx (The Rainbow) support (software list and hiscore) [udance4ever]
Classic game written by David Billen and released in the October 1985 issue of The Rainbow magazine (pp. 65-71)
checksums calculated using ZONX.DSK dump downloaded from colorcomputerarchive.com.zip)
tested in Batocera Linux (MAME v0.261) after manually updating:
1. `/usr/bin/mame/hash/coco_flop.xml`
2. `/usr/bin/mame/plugins/hiscore/hiscore.dat`
and zipping ZONX.DSK into `/userdata/roms/coco/zonx.zip`

12383: emucore.h: fix build error on VC++ [SpecLad]
This compiler requires exception classes to be copyable, because it copies the exception object as part of
  `std::current_exception()`. This means that code like the following has to work:
    emu_fatalerror e1(...);
    emu_fatalerror e2(e1);
However, it doesn't, because in this case the perfect-forwarding constructor is a better match than the copy constructor. So the
  compiler tries to instantiate the perfect-forwarding constructor with `Format`=`emu_fatalerror &`, which fails, since that's not a
  valid format string type.
To fix this, disable the perfect-forwarding constructor when `Format` is a subclass of `emu_fatalerror`.
Fixes #11316

Addition of Print Club Vol. 3 to the Sega C2 driver.

* Print Club hardware documented in top comments, specifically daughterboards and separate analog board
* Notes about Puyo Puyo 2's link capabilities added in upper comment area
### NOTE FOR REVIEWERS:
NOTE: The protection has not yet been dumped or reversed. I do not know where to begin with this, or if I should be trying to dump
  the Altera device directly, or what. I am requesting guidance on this matter. For now, I have a stand-in protection function, just
  copied from the previous volume.

12408: HP9816A added [fulivi]
Hi,
with this PR I'm adding the support for HP9816A system. ROM images will follow at the usual mail address.
I got the idea to write a driver for 9816 because I stumbled on my name listed as copyright holder of `hp9k.cpp`. Here this same
  system was implemented but only at skeleton level. I think someone mistakenly put my name there because I never contributed a
  single line to that file. Do you think we should remove the old implementation?
Thanks.

12427: cpu/f2mc16: Add and fix several instructions [qufb]
Added instructions required to emulate Tomy Prin-C. Also added some fatal errors in order to not silently ignore missing
  instructions.
The following bugs were fixed:
* `ADD A, #imm8`/`SUB A, #imm8`: bits 8 to 15 of A must be zero-extended;
* `ADDL A, @RWx + disp8`/`SUBL A, @RWx + disp8`/`CMPL A, @RWx + disp8`/`ANDL A, @RWx + disp8`: 8-bit displacement fetched as 4
  instead of 1 byte;
* `ADDSP #imm8`: 8-bit immediate must be sign-extended;
* `BLE`/`BGT`/`BHI`: Operator `or` must have precedence over checked condition value;
* `EXT`: Z flag was set on PC instead of PS;
* `MOVW @RWx + disp8, #imm16`: 8-bit displacement fetched as 2 instead of 1 byte;
* `MOV A, @RWx + RW7`/`MOV @RWx + RW7, A`: PC incremented by 3 instead of 2 bytes;
* `MOV @RWx + RW7, #imm8`: Operand fetched with 3-bit instead of 1-bit mask, also missing fetch to 8-bit immediate (reused previous
  variable value);
* `MOVSI ADB, DTB`/`FILSI ADB`: Only first loop iteration was computed, and PC was only conditionally set (also took the chance to
  generalize these instructions for all banks);
* `MOVW @RWx + disp16, #imm16`/`ADD @RWx, A`/`ORW A, @RWx`: Operand fetched with 7-bit instead of 3-bit mask;
* `MOVX A, @RWx + disp8`: missing NZ flags update;
Adjusted instructions with incorrect number of cycles:
* `ASRW A, R0`/`LSRW A, R0`/`LSR A, R0`: used 5 instead of 1 additional cycles per iteration;
* `LSLL A, R0`: 6 cycles were discounted again when R0 != 0;
* Several instructions were not considering additional addressing cycles;

12439: imagedev/floppy: fix a bug with reading the first 1-bit on a track [SpecLad]
`floppy_image_device::find_index` uses binary search to find the index for which `buf[spos] <= position < buf[spos + 1]`. However,
  the algorithm behaves incorrectly when `position < buf[0]`. In this case, the algorithm returns 0, as if `position` was between
  `buf[0]` and `buf[1]`.
The effect of this is that if `get_next_transition` is called with a timestamp that is between the start of the revolution and the
  first transition, then instead of returning the timestamp of that transition, it returns the timestamp of the second transition
  instead. Essentially, the first 1-bit on the track gets flipped to a 0.
I have encountered this in Apple II emulation, where this bug manifests as sporadic I/O errors.
Fix it by doing two things:
1. Replace `find_index` with a call to `upper_bound` from the standard library, which behaves correctly in edge cases.
2. If `upper_bound` signals that `position < buf[0]`, then adjust `base` and `index` to point to the last transition of the previous
  revolution.

12440: sinclair/spec128.cpp,sinclair/specpls3.cpp: adjust border chunk render position [holub]
Make border render adjustments based on latest tests

12441: drivenum.cpp: fix undefined behavior in find_approximate_matches [SpecLad]
If `it` points to the last element of `penalty`, the `resize` call invalidates it, and the subsequent call to `emplace` is
  undefined. This causes a crash in MSVC debug mode.
Fix it by resizing _after_ emplacing.

12443: cpu/f2mc16: Add additional instructions from Prin-C disassembly [qufb]

12445: cpu/z80/z80.cpp Update core generator to support r800 [holub, Wilbert Pol] [holub]
Update for z80 generation to support case required in #12433
Now core avoid partial generation and always build full commands list which looks cleaner based on the z80n and r800 requirements

12452: imagedev/floppy.cpp: fix out-of-bounds access to the seek sample [SpecLad]
Currently, when `floppy_sound_device::step` selects a new seek sample, the value of `m_seek_samplepos` remains the same as it was
  the last time a seek sample was played. This might be an invalid position for the new sample, since the seek samples have
  different lengths. When this is the case, the next call to `floppy_sound_device::sound_stream_update` makes an out-of-bounds
  memory access as it reads the sample data.
Fix this by resetting `m_seek_samplepos` to 0 when a new seek sample is selected.
This also makes the seek sounds more consistent, since previously they would start from a semi-random position each time.

12473: sony/news_r3k.cpp, sony/news_r4k.cpp, sony/news_68k.cpp, sony/news_38xx.cpp: Add software list for Sony NEWS systems
  [briceonk]
Because both the r3k and r4k have some level of binary compatibility, I added these into the same software list even though the
  current entries only work for OS installs on one or the other, so I can change this if having separate ones would be preferred.

12474: cpu/z80/z80.cpp: Fix compile error [holub]

12475: cpu/z80/z80.cpp: Move busrq check to service step [holub]

12486: igs/igs_fear.cpp: replace XA dump in superkds, old one was bad [XingXing] [mamehaze]
working on the disassembler highlighted some opcodes that didn't decode correctly in the 80c51XA dump in superkds, turns out it was
  just bad, one of the pins was floating so XingXing redumped it.

12487: Benesse work / new NOT WORKING Machine (Challenge Gear) [mamehaze]
New NOT WORKING Machine
----------
Challenge Gear [TeamEurope, SSJ, Youkal3]
New NOT WORKING Software List Entries
---------
challenge_gear_cart.xml:
Challenge 6 Years [TeamEurope, SSJ, Youkal3]
- moved pockchal.cpp and the new driver to a benesse folder, as benesse had many more products
- created a separate machine for the Pocket Challenge v2, the BIOS isn't dumped, but carts aren't physically compatible with a
  Wonderswan even if the software is.  Makes more sense to have a driver with the borrowed Wonderswan BIOS marked as BAD_DUMP than
  hiding everything behind the Wonderswan itself.

12488: new WORKING software list additions - GameKing3 2030 [mamehaze]

12489: machine/am9513.cpp: fixed wrong log message for cascading TCs [Elektraglide]
Logging wants to show previous channel number but because channels when printed start at 1,  cliche is to always print 'c+1' meaning
  previous channel number is (c-1)+1  aka c  not c-1.

12490: konami/ksys573: Initialize m_pccard_cd [987123879113]
`m_pccard_cd` is in an uninitialized state after the recent PC card changes which is causing some Sys573 games to behave incorrectly
  (most notably ddrjb freezing on boot), so this PR initializes them to 1. Also fixed a small indentation issue I noticed.

12493: recfranco/rf51w14cg.cpp: Mark the Santa Fe Mine reels PIC as NO_DUMP [clawgrip]
It was protected, the dump is useless

12496: correct challenge gear cart name, add list of undumped carts [mamehaze]

 * FMOVE of a float to a Dx integer register generates the exception status bits, fixing square roots in SANE
 * Rewrote how FMOVEM instructions are decoded and executed, fixing issues including skipping too few or too many opcode bytes and
    causing serious weird behavior.
 * FPU instructions all now have more realistic cycle timings for a 68881.
 * All FPU instructions now generate exception bits in FPSR.
   - 3rdparty/softfloat3: Updates [R. Belmont]
 * Softfloat3 was always being built for a big-endian host, causing incorrect math on LE x64 and AArch64 machines.
 * Fixed up Softfloat3 to build properly as part of MAME and up-ported the Bochs extensions.  In latest Bochs, they were only
    partially up-ported and Softfloat3 had been hacked up to be more like 2; here they're fixed to work with stock Softfloat3.

-imagedev/floppy: fix a bug with reading the first 1-bit on a track (#12439) [Roman Donchenko]
 * `floppy_image_device::find_index` uses binary search to find the index for which `buf[spos] <= position < buf[spos + 1]`.
    However, the algorithm behaves incorrectly when `position < buf[0]`. In this case, the algorithm returns 0, as if `position` was
    between `buf[0]` and `buf[1]`.
 * The effect of this is that if `get_next_transition` is called with a timestamp that is between the start of the revolution and
    the first transition, then instead of returning the timestamp of that transition, it returns the timestamp of the second
    transition instead. Essentially, the first 1-bit on the track gets flipped to a 0.
 * I have encountered this in Apple II emulation, where this bug manifests as sporadic I/O errors.
 * Fix it by doing two things:
 * 1. Replace `find_index` with a call to `upper_bound` from the standard library, which behaves correctly in edge cases.
 * 2. If `upper_bound` signals that `position < buf[0]`, then adjust `base` and `index` to point to the last transition of the
    previous revolution.

-imagedev/floppy.cpp: fix out-of-bounds access to the seek sample (#12452) [Roman Donchenko]
 * Currently, when `floppy_sound_device::step` selects a new seek sample, the value of `m_seek_samplepos` remains the same as it was
    the last time a seek sample was played. This might be an invalid position for the new sample, since the seek samples have
    different lengths. When this is the case, the next call to `floppy_sound_device::sound_stream_update` makes an out-of-bounds
    memory access as it reads the sample data.
 * Fix this by resetting `m_seek_samplepos` to 0 when a new seek sample is selected.
 * This also makes the seek sounds more consistent, since previously they would start from a semi-random position each time.
